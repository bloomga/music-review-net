metrics:
root mean square error vs mean square error?: http://zerospectrum.com/2019/06/02/mae-vs-mse-vs-rmse/
answer: root mean square error
because it is a regression problem, we will use be minimizing root mean square error: ie the loss function will be rmse
-we may do cross validation, however this is computationally expensive
-we can graph loss vs over epoch
-we can also graph val loss over epoch
-we can graph accuracy over epoch
-scatterplot of actual vs predicted
-max residual (diff between predicted and actual)
-min residual
-R^2
-compare to benchmark of normal distribution predicting values

milestones:
prep stage
-get access to lab
-get metacritic scraper working and produce dataset
-continuous learnig/research

preprocess stage
-preprocess datasets to make the same formatting
-produce standardized  score versions of the datasets
-preprocess datsets to prepare for training/testing

coding stage
-write model
-debug model
-optimize/improve model (see if we can push loss lower)
--cross validation: https://machinelearningmastery.com/evaluate-performance-deep-learning-models-keras/
--https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/351808/lstm-time-series-forecasting-accuracy
--advanced preprocessing: http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2011/MehtaPhilipScaria-Predicting%20Star%20Ratings%20from%20Movie%20Review%20Comments.pdf

training stage
-train on non standardized data and analyze results
-train on standardized data and analyze results
--if we compare predictions made from standardized data to non-standardized data we need to inverse_transform the score of the prediction

'stretches':
-p4k datset version with "best new music reissues" removed?
--train on p4k dataset best new music reissues removed and best new music reissues kept
---determine which is better
-including genre/artist data?

produce presentation and written project report



Things we can/should do:
train 1 net on just p4k, 1 net on metacritic(homogenous) reviews
-compare performance of both of these on both just p4k and homogenous each
-possible reasons for difference
**p4k has different mean or std dev of scores
**p4k uses a different vocabulary
-thus we can also train on the same data, but standardize the scores:
**eliminates possibility that p4k has different mean or std dev of scores

things to find/results:
-differences between p4k model and metacritic model when evaluated on both testing sets
--possible explanations? (this is conclusion material-i dont know what hard claims we can make)
-how many epochs till loss stops decreasing?

possible problems:
-some review sites use a score decided by group of critics, review written by only 1 critic. (needs citation)

Assorted to do:
comment metacritic scraper-(Gavin)
produce output file from metacrtitic scraper with same format as p4k dataset file

reminders:
no need for sigmoid in regression
