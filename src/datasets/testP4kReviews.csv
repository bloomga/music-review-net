"1","A.M./Being There","Wilco",1,"December 6 2017","Rock","Best new reissue 1 / 2 Albums Newly reissued and remastered, the group’s first two albums find Jeff Tweedy and his Chicago band transforming themselves from alt-country also-rans into a formidable rock‘n’roll outfit. The nuclear detonation of Uncle Tupelo launched an alt-country arms race, with the band’s two chief singer-songwriters mutating from old friends into bitter enemies trying to outdo each other with their follow-up records. Jay Farrar started Son Volt with Tupelo’s drummer, Mike Heidorn, and released Trace, which yielded the radio hit “Drown” and found him greeted as a visionary. Jeff Tweedy, on the other hand, rushed into the studio to record a set of demos with his new band, Wilco, barely a couple months after his old band had played its final show. Nearly a year later they released their first album, A.M., which was greeted with a big shrug from critics and fans alike. Tweedy had managed to retain almost every member of Uncle Tupelo’s expanded line-up: multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston, guitarist John Stirratt, drummer Ken Coomer, even guitarist Brian Henneman, of the Bottle Rockets. In fact, the group briefly flirted with the idea of keeping the Uncle Tupelo name, although wiser heads prevailed and they rechristened themselves after trucker lingo for “will comply.” Still, despite their familiarity and camaraderie, Wilco were still trying to figure out who they were when they wrote and recorded A.M.—a necessary step for any band, but especially for one whose de facto frontman had spent the last decade-plus in the shadow of the more forceful Farrar. The original mix of A.M. was, reportedly, much grittier and more akin to Uncle Tupelo’s early material than to the cleaner, more polished version that finally made its way into CD stores in March 1995. The final version is fine, although A.M. is the very definition of 1990s alt-country: as conservative as punk rock, with flourishes of pedal steel and a gentle twang to frame Tweedy’s hard-luck tales of casino losing streaks, suspended licenses, and custody battles over record collections. “I Must Be High” nods toward the sunny pop of Summerteeth and beyond, and “Box Full of Letters” and “Passenger Side” hint at the melancholy melodicism that would become Tweedy’s stock in trade. He wanted Wilco to be a collaborative and democratic unit rather than a glorified solo project, though only one of his bandmates’ songs made the final cut: the gently loping “It’s Just That Simple,” courtesy of Stirratt (who pens the new liner notes for this expanded edition). Otherwise, the MVP of the album is Henneman, who was a fine foil for Tweedy. There’s real wit and warmth in his guitar riffs, even if he was merely a rental rather than a full band member. According to Learning How to Die, Greg Kot’s 2004 biography of the band, Henneman recorded his part for the raucous throwaway “Casino Queen” while nursing a broken heart; he downed two bottles of gin before the tape started rolling, and he plays like he’s holding on for dear life. A.M. is an album persistently defined by unfavorable comparisons, first to Son Volt’s Trace and later to every other Wilco album. And certainly there’s a timidity here that must have been discouraging after Tweedy’s strong contributions to Uncle Tupelo’s final pair of albums. But there’s also a lot of humor and sadness to these songs, which are circumscribed and local in their scope. That’s the charm of this modest reissue, which includes only a handful of bonus tracks (including the final Uncle Tupelo recording and a Blue Mountain cover) but treats A.M. as something more than a footnote to Wilco’s long career. In 2017, the album plays like a band setting its terms, striving to keep everything perfectly human-size. As much as the band was compared to that other Uncle Tupelo offshoot, Wilco’s biggest rivals were themselves. Tweedy, meanwhile, was struggling to grow up. Then in his late 20s, he quit smoking pot, a vice he’d adopted after quitting drinking a few years before. He married his girlfriend and prepared to become a father. And he made some painful adjustments to his expectations once A.M. floundered and ticket sales cratered. If he hadn’t turned those setbacks into songs, you probably wouldn’t be reading a review of any Wilco reissues. Being There is every bit as confident as their debut was shaky: a double album tied together by a loose theme of what it means to be in a rock‘n’roll band. It opens with a big blast of lurching, serrating guitar distortion, sinewy and visceral and violent, which sounds like they’re tearing up A.M. so they can start over again. What’s amazing is how well it works. After the grinding din that begins and ends opener “Misunderstood,” Tweedy’s songs have a brand new context. “Far, Far Away” and “I Got You (At the End of the Century)” aren’t actually that different from A.M., but they sound heavier, riskier, the stakes so much greater that it could be a different band altogether. There are some country flourishes, specifically the pedal steel courtesy of Freakwater’s Bob Egan, but Wilco had managed to transform itself from an alt-country also-ran into a real rock band: noise rock, classic rock, folk rock, heartland rock, every kind of rock. A conceptually knotty record, Being There contains barely veiled references to a breakup, but most listeners at the time would have understood them as references to Uncle Tupelo rather than a romantic partner. “Monday,” with its Stonesy brass stomp, is about a guy in “a plenty good band” who can only watch as others get all the glory, and you can guess what might have inspired Tweedy’s wry observations about fame and futility.  There are a few pulled punches (“I know you’re just a mama’s boy” doesn’t have much sting), but thankfully, these aren’t dis tracks or bitter recriminations. Jay Farrar’s only a minor concern; these songs are first and foremost about Jeff Tweedy and his misgivings about his own talent. That had been a detriment on A.M.; on Being There it’s the band’s greatest strength and truest subject. Rock‘n’roll is a sucker’s bet on these songs, something you pour your heart and soul and money and labor and dreams into and for what? Creative and financial frustration? “We’ve got solid-state technology,” Tweedy sings on “Red-Eyed and Blue”; “Tapes on the floor/Some songs we can’t afford to play.” So, why were they even doing it? That’s what Wilco are trying to figure out on Being There, and they need your help. It’s useful to imagine each of these songs being sung from the stage directly and explicitly to the audience who has paid to see Wilco. As Tweedy sings on “I Got You (At the End of the Century),” “I got you and I still believe that you’re all that I will ever need/It’s you.” That “you” means us. Are we enough for them? Is our applause really that valuable? Being There flirts with cynicism, but really the mood is sober, world-weary, adult. “There is no sunken treasure/Rumored to be wrapped inside my ribs,” Tweedy sings on “Sunken Treasure,” the slow-burn epic that anchors the second disc of this double album. “Music is my savior/I was maimed by rock and roll.” If rock had once been a liberating medium, after Nirvana it had become an albatross around the neck of every dreamer with a guitar. But Tweedy finds his way in the end: Closer “Dreamer in My Dreams” may be the most unflinchingly personal song on the record, but it’s also the wildest, the wooliest, maybe the most raucous Wilco have ever sounded. “Well I know I’ve made mistakes,” he sings; “I’m passing them on.” Just when you think the song is ending, the band kicks it up again, as though reluctant to stop playing. Only when the song ends do they have to face real life again. At the heart of this bruised and tender record is the frazzled relationship between artist and audience, which makes this reissue more powerful and essential than your typical album repackaging. Digital media means we as an audience have less and less to give an artist, and rock‘n’roll may be even more of a fool’s errand now than it was in 1996, when people bought CDs by the handful and even a mid-level band like pre-Foxtrot Wilco could make a comfortable living driving around the country in a van. Being There sounds even direr and more desperate than it once did, and the bonus material expands upon its themes. The “Party Horn” mix of “Monday” actually sounds richer and more excitable than the studio version, especially with its screeching sax solo. Most of the outtakes and alternate takes still have studio chatter attached to them, showing the band goofing around in the studio or half-assing the demos. “I think that was good enough,” Tweedy deadpans after a beautifully understated version of “Dynamite My Soul.” All of Tweedy’s big ideas about his vocation sound even more volatile on the two full live sets included on the 5xCD version, with “Sunken Treasure” and “Hotel Arizona” making the most of Tweedy’s rapport with the audience (“This is a true story. Sorta.”) and the noise of the crowd. Maybe that’s where the album’s title comes from. It is, of course, a reference to the 1979 Peter Sellers film, but it’s also a twist on the old adage about concerts and concert films: I guess you had to be there. We’ve always been a crucial part of Being There, always an unseen force motivating Wilco from one show to the next, but these live cuts make it explicit. It’s as though Tweedy played the long game on this sucker’s bet, waiting 21 years to make the ultimate version of Being There.",7
"2","No Shame","Hopsin",0,"December 6 2017","Rap","On his corrosive fifth album, the rapper takes aim at several targets and whiffs spectacularly. His verbose, tryhard technique is a tired formula he employs without flow, direction, or meaning. Hopsin—the California rapper whose constricting flows and humorless turns suck all the fun out of rapping—made his reputation appealing to the angstier corners of the internet, inhabited by rap moralists and “alternative thinkers”—those who earnestly think Tech N9ne is Peak Underground Rap. His new album, No Shame, is a bitter, petulant response to recent setbacks and mistakes: the collapse of his Funk Volume label, the souring of personal and professional relationships, and losing custody of his son after pleading guilty to assault. But he refuses to back down. “I built this empire off rebellion/Niggas seem to have a problem with what I be sellin’,” he raps on “Panorama City,” a song using a “California Love” sample as a Thug Life signifier. When given the chance to explain himself, he doubles down on the worst aspects of an irritating persona. No Shame is a misfired revenge stunt. He takes aim at several targets and whiffs spectacularly, producing the worst album of his career, filled with tryhard wordplay and defamation that verges on abuse. “This album is backlash for somebody else. This album is pretty much just karma for people who have screwed me over or done something wrong to me,” he told Tim Westwood. Those people are his former business partner, manager, and Funk Volume co-founder, Damien Ritter, and his ex-girlfriend, who Hopsin was arrested for assaulting in Australia last year. The barbs he has for Ritter are boring enough, but those reserved for his ex are particularly dark. Hopsin leaves no room for interpretation: He uses No Shame (and the press tour promoting it) to get back at the mother of his child, to damage her any way he can: “I fuckin’ hate this bitch, her name could sit on a grave/Only reason she ain’t dead is ‘cause my kid on the way/The bitch is pregnant and she strippin’, dodgin’ minimum wage/She done kick me down, locked me up, and spit on my face,” he raps, enraged on “All Your Fault (Remix).” This is a rapper using the full weight of his musical machine to discredit a woman he pled guilty to assaulting. And even for all his attempts to disgrace and humiliate her, smearing her with slut-shaming tactics and leveraging the entire force of his fan base against her, he still comes off looking much worse. Hopsin takes pride in his writing, making fun of “mumble rappers” and those he perceives to be lesser lyricists, but his ideas are always articulated in the most corrosive ways possible; his set-ups and images are awkward, distasteful, and off-putting. Creepiness is an important part of his aesthetic—the colored contact lenses, deranged rambler rhyme mechanics (a la Eminem), and so-sinister-they’re-campy performances are all tools he uses to paint himself as a rap iconoclast. But even he pushes the limits of likability on No Shame. Slim Shady is his patron saint, and “Rap God” is his scripture. All of his defining principles originate there, only executed without grace or guile. Even his horrible, vitriolic anti-ex tirades are cribbed right from the “Kim” playbook.  Rage isn’t a substitute for artistry. He’ll rap nonsense for the sake of the scheme (”Napalm in my dang palm/I’m a dark villain like Blade, Spawn, or Akon with a cape on”). His scenes are insipid. His phrasings are either basic and unsophisticated or simply unnatural, playing up the phonetics as a distraction. “Evil and purgin’, I am more deceiving in person/Screamin’ and cursin’, fuck the world with penis insertions/I’ma feel this way until the day I’m leavin’ this Earth, man,” he raps on “Witch Doctor.” You can almost hear him asking himself, “what rhymes with this?” making raps purposelessly denser with complete disregard for syntax. The songs that aren’t vehicles for his hatred are pointless exercises, each an elaborate convolution. Most Hopsin verses are assembled the same way, with choppy, rapid-fire cadences of multisyllabic filler. Every diphthong and accent ricochets off the next, creating the illusion of mastery when really, it’s less complex than letting an algorithm generate raps from scratch. There’s no value in craftsmanship alone; there has to be flow, direction, and meaning. “Rap monster, Black Mamba/You can’t run from the wrath I’ve been asked to cast on ya/To all the haters who been keepin’ up with my every move/Here’s my penis to latch on/I’m the only MC in this wack genre,” he raps, following his technicality-first formula. And if there was any doubt that he’s detrimentally a creature of habit, he’s now nine songs deep in an “Ill Mind of Hopsin” series that ran out of ideas four songs ago. Things get even more unpleasant when Hopsin takes detours. On “Happy Ending,” he raps about getting off at a massage parlor in a terrible mock accent, mimicking the masseuse for the hook: “If you no say nothing, I can give you sucky-sucky.” It would be one thing if the song was just crude or offensive or unlistenable, but it’s a trifecta. There aren’t any moments of remorse or thoughtfulness on No Shame, but there are a few moments of reflection. “I don’t like Marcus, I don’t like Hopsin/I am ashamed of them both,” he raps on “Marcus’ Gospel” before concluding, “I made my bed, I’ma lay in it.” These bars would have you believe Hopsin has learned from his mistakes. But No Shame proves otherwise. The album rebukes any and all responsibility for his current predicament, shifting blame onto others. And in an attempt to weaponize his raps against his adversaries, he exposes his deepest flaws. His album is a reminder that shame is a productive and even necessary thing, keeping us from further making fools of ourselves.",3.5
"3","Material Control","Glassjaw",0,"December 6 2017","Rock","On their first album in 15 years, the Long Island post-hardcore band Glassjaw picks up right where they left off. But their heaviest material yet is, at times, lacking in dynamics and atmosphere. Material Control wouldn’t exist if Daryl Palumbo didn’t believe it was “the most Glassjaw-sounding music we could be making at this point.” There is no doubting the purity of their vision, as lead single “New White Extremity” is Glassjaw as hell. Its aggression and abrasive, abstract skronk tie together New York hardcore and no wave, mixed with astringent third-wave emo melody and the CGI’d musculature of nu-metal production—all with Palumbo doing his ocean-sized roar over it all like Long Island’s answer to Perry Farrell. In 2015, the band released “New White Extremity” as a one-off, assumed to lead up to this very moment, where it serves as the opener for the first Glassjaw album in 15 years. If there was any doubt whether Glassjaw can pick up where they left off, Material Control answers it as immediately and literally as possible. Whether or not they were doubted, Glassjaw were going to act as if they were. They’re a band that’s thrived in a state of constant conflict. Fan favorites from their 2000 debut Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence include “Pretty Lush” and “Ry-Ry’s Song,” chief exhibits among the evidence of their scene’s ingrained misogyny. These were scorched-earth responses to romantic betrayal performed with such energy that they sound like an endorsement. With their 2002 album Worship and Tribute, Glassjaw were positioned as post-hardcore’s Next Big Thing, forged under the pressure of Warner Bros. execs, the Twin Towers of nu-metal (producer Ross Robinson, mixer Chris Lord-Alge), and the band’s own outsized ambitions. It didn’t have the impact of, say, Relationship of Command, but like At the Drive In, Glassjaw followed their frenzied, fraught breakthrough by taking the next decade off. While creating Material Control, multi-instrumentalist Justin Beck (he and Palumbo constitute the core of Glassjaw) asked a rhetorical question: “Yo, if we were 14 again and recording with Martin Bisi and could just be the illest, grimiest band in New York, what would the environment be like?” This is a smart approach, especially in the wake of recent albums from post-hardcore greats like At the Drive In, Refused, and Quicksand. Think of the fan who found those other albums to be hella soft, who wrongly assumed that Palumbo would remain too committed to the pop ambitions of his regrettably-named electronica outfits Head Automatica and Colour Film—Material Control is for that person. Material Control certainly can lay claim to being Glassjaw’s heaviest or most aggro album. And though most of Palumbo’s lyrics are too circumspect to get much across beyond their titles (“My Conscience Weighs a Ton,” “Bibleland 6”), he says it’s political in a “George Carlin way.” “New White Extremity” surveys the demographics of a new Brooklyn, which Beck describes as “white people from Kansas.” Despite their multimedia affinity for gruff, hardscrabble NYC cynicism, Material Control lives in the now, one of constant physical and mental confrontation and claustrophobia. Like their hardcore heroes, Glassjaw want you to feel the experience of getting constantly elbowed on the street and the subway, only now it also happens while staring at an iPhone and getting constantly prodded by bad opinions. Nearly every second of Material Control is meant to duplicate this sensory overload. Beck, in particular, puts forth a performance of remarkable endurance and dexterity, neck-snap riffs constantly battling his textural playing in the right channel, intended as field recordings from the concrete jungle—circular saws meeting sheet metal, the blare of car horns, jammed traffic. Without Dillinger Escape Plan to use as an outlet anymore, drummer Billy Rymer pushes his new band to their most feral extremes, shuttling from groove-metal, d-beat insanity, free-form dub, and tabla-spiked drone in consecutive tracks. But Glassjaw are so intent on proving they can still Glassjaw that they leave no space to build, to create dynamics or generate atmosphere. They really leave no space for Palumbo, and while there are distinct choruses, there are no hooks. There are more memorable basslines than vocal melodies. If Glassjaw was expected to top their forebears like Orange 9mm and Mind Over Matter as a commercial proposition, though, it was due to Palumbo—a “Jeff Buckley-in-hell post-hardcore,” an unusually magnetic presence for this grotty realm. But he can’t work within these arrangements so much as over or under them. Palumbo elongates vowels while improvising pitch and hoping for the best. Elsewhere, he’s almost completely submerged in a mix created without nuance or mercy. If you can withstand the initial onslaught of Material Control, it can be plucked for stems: the cooed harmonies on “Shira,” the warm bass countermelodies from “Golgotha,” any of the individual elements of “Pretty Hell.” The latter serves as the kind of U-turn into amniotic balladry that has sustained the midsections of Deftones albums for the past 20 years. Despite its studied dub production, “Pretty Hell” is a mess that wastes the strongest chorus on an arrangement where no instrument appears to be aware of the other’s existence. There are points where Glassjaw can work towards a satisfying payoff rather than going all in at once, like the raga experiment “Bastille Day” and the title track, which both aspire to the symphonic grandeur of major-label Trail of Dead. To Palumbo’s credit, he recognizes the potency of being that angry, impulsive 14-year-old hardcore kid—though he’s now channeling his adolescent rage towards more worthy targets. On an immediate level, Material Control is a record that simply feels good to have, specifically at the end of 2017—a time when everyone’s coming together to praise the year’s most agreeable rock records, when every day brings further proof that the arc of the moral universe has gone way the fuck off course, when you just want to scream into the void. Think of Material Control as a post-hardcore Long Island tea: it’ll take you back to being a teen when you could care less what was in it and how it was mixed together. The only thing that mattered was whether you got knocked on your ass.",6.6
"4","Weighing of the Heart","Nabihah Iqbal",0,"December 6 2017","Pop/R&B","On her debut LP, British producer Nabihah Iqbal—fka Throwing Shade—has a rare touch with inky new wave synths and drum machines, emerging as a songwriter of impressive emotional heft. On May 3, 1993, New Order released Republic, their long-awaited sixth studio album. A month later, it was joined in the stores by Souvlaki, the second long player from Reading shoegazers Slowdive. The British producer and DJ Nabihah Iqbal was a child at the time, but her debut album sits on a stylistic shelf between them. Weighing of the Heart is first full-length from Iqbal to not bear her former moniker, Throwing Shade, the modish alter ego that she inhabited from 2009 to mid-2017. Iqbal has explained that the decision to do away with the Throwing Shade alias was driven by a desire to stand as a British-Asian artist making music. But the move also feels appropriate on an album where Iqbal rolls back the fashionable club production of her previous work in favor of a sound that is more personal and emotive. Gone are the bleeding-edge electronic beats and globe-trotting influences that Iqbal previously preferred on tracks like “hashtag IRL.” In a recent interview, Iqbal said she avoided listening to new music while working on this album, reflecting instead on the music of her teenage years. She mentions Joy Division and Bauhaus as influences as well as ""Sowt ‘Leiko Kamam Bian Tara Lod Biaran’"" by R & R Zangeshahi, the latter not so much as a sonic marker as for the emotional response it brings from the listener. The inky hands of Joy Division’s later incarnation as New Order are all over Weighing of the Heart. Album highlight “Saw U Twice” is a hugely satisfying retread of the early New Order sound, when the band bolted on synths to add dashes of color to their Mancunian morosity. “Saw U Twice” sees sparse guitar lines meet melodic bass counterpoint, airy electronic washes and drums that vacillate between post-punk dungeon and New York disco, each perfectly weighed. This combination, repeated on the album’s best tracks, may not appear particularly original in late 2017, when New Order’s influence is evident in bands from LCD Soundsystem to The Killers. But Iqbal lifts her music into rather more original territory thanks to vocals that borrow from the chiffon singing style of shoegaze acts like Slowdive or The Telescopes, her fusion of two popular musical influences creating something greater than the sum of its parts. It helps that Iqbal is a frequently fantastic songwriter. The spaces and separation inherent in the New Order sound mean that there is no room to hide your dirty musical laundry; every component must be finely tuned to work, both individually and as part of the whole. Iqbal pulls off this delicate balancing act with aplomb, packing the album with wonderful instrumental touches, from the chiming guitar intro to “Something More” to the luminescent bassline that lifts the midsection of “Eternal Passion” to the dramatic cymbal crashes on “Saw U Twice.” To this, she adds vocal lines that combine earworm melodies with a road-worn melancholy, transforming lyrics such as  “Saw you on the train/Will I see you again?” (from “Saw U Twice”) into the kind of quotidian lament that is inherent in the most relatable pop music. Iqbal’s lyrical skills are particularly prominent on “Zone 1 to 6000,” a song that takes the influence of English poets William Blake and Matthew Arnold into the drudgery and release of 21st-century London. The combination of Iqbal’s deadpan delivery, brilliantly evocative synth chords, and lines like, “We wander through each other's lives/Just like the river's constant flow” make the song a dead ringer for a 2017 “West End Girls.” When this combination of hooky, relatable songwriting works, Weighing of the Heart delivers some of the finest, most viscerally satisfying electronic pop music of the year. At times, though, Iqbal seems to let her winning formula get away from her. “In Visions” feels like two entirely separate songs meeting up and not getting along, the vocal sitting on top of the musical bed like a misconstrued mix you wish the DJ would put out of its agony. “Eden Piece,” which opens the album, foregoes a proper vocal melody in favor of rather formless “oohs” and “aahs” and a wandering piano line. “Slowly,” meanwhile, relies almost entirely on the vocal line, supported only by mopey synth chords and the kind of off-putting, twiddling guitar that might adorn a Scorpions B side. It’s a drag, in all senses of the word. Weighing of the Heart is not perfect, then, but most New Order albums also contain their fair share of imperfections and missteps (and somehow it makes us love them more). As Throwing Shade, Iqbal was already one of electronic music’s most engaging polymaths, thanks to a resumé that included everything from vocalist on SOPHIE’s “Lemonade” to a stint as a human rights lawyer. With Weighing of the Heart, Iqbal adds another couple of strings to her bow, emerging as a pop auteur and songwriter of impressive emotional heft.",7.7
"5","The Visitor","Neil Young / Promise of the Real",0,"December 5 2017","Rock","While still pointedly political, Neil Young’s latest with Promise of the Real takes a more freewheeling, macro look at the world and becomes more centered than his recent albums. At the age of 72, Neil Young has forgone most of his contemporaries’ chosen tenures. For the most part, he still operates exactly how he has since the 1970s, with new work arriving constantly and chaotically in bursts of inspiration, with little logic dictating what gets released and what doesn’t. Over the last decade, reuniting with Crazy Horse has proven as likely to inspire new music as, say, buying a new car, or hanging out for an afternoon in Jack White’s recording booth. Even if his hit-or-miss ratio has tipped, it’s hard to think of an artist who’s stayed truer to their muse for so long. When visualizing the span of his career, Young landed on the image a messy filing cabinet—cluttered and spilling over with information. The Visitor, Neil Young’s 39th record, is a sprawling and boundless project. Teaming again with Willie Nelson’s sons Lukas and Micah and their band Promise of the Real, it harkens back to records like 1989’s Freedom, when Young’s wandering interests stood proudly in defiance of cohesion. As evidenced by its first single—the artfully awkward cut-and-paste stomp “Already Great”—The Visitor often plays like Young’s impassioned response to the first year of the Trump administration. The president’s slogans and catchphrases are lobbed back at him in songs like “Already Great” and “When Bad Got Good,” while “Stand Tall” takes aim at a “boy king” who refutes scientific fact to spew hate. While its topical lyrics stand out, The Visitor isn’t so easily summarized. This is not simply a collection of protest songs, and even its more pointed tracks tend to zoom out, incorporating political observations as stray thoughts, not thesis statements. In the lapping “Almost Always,” Young addresses a “game show host who has to brag and has to boast ’bout tearin’ down the things that I hold dear.” But the mood passes; by the end of the song, he’s urging us to consider instead the mating pattern of birds. If Young’s recent work has felt like a series of hard-headed dives into his pet obsessions—more interesting for simply existing than for actually listening to—then The Visitor is more all-encompassing, and as a result, more centered. After backing him on 2015’s The Monsanto Years and its semi-live companion album Earth, the members of Promise of the Real seem palpably relieved to no longer be dealing with songs exclusively about food justice. Despite their tendency to ham up every song (contrast Neil’s recent solo rendition of “Stand Tall” with the album version, where his bandmates resort to chanting along with him after certain words), it’s clear that they have a deep reverence for and understanding of his work. One can imagine these twentysomethings are to thank for deep cuts like “Winterlong” and “Western Hero” appearing on recent setlists. While Young remains hell-bent on moving forward, Promise of the Real are happy to revisit his past glories. They bring back the opening riff from Harvest Moon’s “Unknown Legend” periodically through “Almost Always.” And in the excellent closing track, “Forever,” they transport the haunted chill of his 1974 classic On the Beach to Neil’s current worldview—one that depicts our planet as a “church without a preacher,” where “the people have to pray for themselves.” That particular song spans ten weary, heart-worn minutes, gliding by with a gentle pulse. That patience lasts the entire record, flowing at an effortless, even pace despite its varying moods. With the exception of a strange meandering vamp about the circus called “Carnival,” genre pastiches—like the bluesy “Diggin’ a Hole”—are mercifully brief, while more fruitful ideas like “Forever” get the space they deserve. Its freewheeling energy highlights two of Young’s greatest strengths: his continuing restlessness and the wisdom that grounds it. The Visitor might not offer any definitive answers to the questions it raises about our planet or our country, but Young seems okay with that. “I’m not gonna work it out right here and right now,” he admits in “Almost Always,” “But I’ll get back to it.” No matter what he returns with, it’s comforting to know we’ve still got him on the case.",6.7
"6","Perfect Angel","Minnie Riperton",1,"December 5 2017","Pop/R&B","Best new reissue A deluxe reissue of Minnie Riperton’s best album—fusing funk, reggae, folk, soul—includes bonus tracks and new liner notes, which elaborate on the process of recording this classic with Stevie Wonder. In 1972, Minnie Riperton was semi-retired from the music business. She was in her mid-20s, married with a young child and another on the way, and wanted an easygoing life away from the industry. So Riperton, her husband Richard Rudolph, and their son Marc moved to Gainesville, Fla., where Richard worked as a weekend disc jockey for WGVL-FM and Riperton quietly wrote songs. For her, the 1960s were littered with short-lived creative endeavors and others that weren’t successful. In 1961, the Chicago native joined a local girl group called the Gems; elsewhere, she sang backup for the Dells and Etta James while working full-time as a receptionist in the office of Chess Records. After releasing a single, “Lonely Girl,” under the pseudonym Andrea Davis, Riperton joined the Rotary Connection, a psychedelic soul band that achieved moderate commercial success before dissolving in the late ’60s. In 1971, Riperton released her solo debut album, Come to My Garden, a gorgeous yet downtempo blend of jazz and orchestral soul that also flew under the radar. Steve Slutzah, then a college rep for Epic Records, found Riperton in Gainesville a year into her sabbatical. He’d been looking for her ever since the Rotary Connection broke up, and he received word that she was there. In Florida, Riperton’s husband played Slutzah a four-song demo that he and Riperton had recorded during a previous stint in Los Angeles. Slutzah loved what he heard so much that he took the demo back to Epic’s A&R rep Don Ellis in New York, who eventually flew south to meet Rudolph and Riperton personally—and sign them. “Don flew out, sat on the floor with us on these big pillows as I played guitar and Minnie sang,” Rudolph said in a 2001 interview. “Next thing we knew, we were flying back to L.A. to make a record.” That record became Perfect Angel, Riperton’s second and best album, which has now been remastered and reissued as a double disc with 11 bonus tracks, including two alternate versions of smash hit “Lovin’ You.” This isn’t the first time Perfect Angel has been reissued: Capitol Records re-released it following Riperton’s untimely death from breast cancer in 1979, when she was 31. But the new reissue includes a 24-page packet of rare photos and extended liner notes by Rudolph that break down Perfect Angel’s full backstory and elaborate on what it was like working in the studio with an icon, Stevie Wonder. Riperton wanted Wonder to produce Perfect Angel, though he was then in the midst of his legendary run of albums, including 1972’s Talking Book and 1973’s Innervisions. Riperton and Wonder had met once before, in 1971, at a black expo in Chicago. They exchanged pleasantries, and Wonder insisted he’d always wanted to work with the singer. Epic didn’t believe Wonder would get on board for Perfect Angel. But an agent got Wonder on the phone, and Riperton found herself at his studio that very day, singing background on “It Ain’t No Use” and “Creepin’,” which would appear on his 1974 album, Fulfillingness’ First Finale. Still, Motown didn’t want Wonder to produce a record for Riperton, who they considered an upstart. So to circumvent Motown, Rudolph and Wonder created a joint company called Scorbu Productions, and Wonder co-produced Perfect Angel with Rudolph under an alias, “El Toro Negro.” On paper, a Riperton-Wonder collab made complete sense. They both sang of trees and flowers, comparing Earth’s grand beauty to the spiritual power of love. To them, love was the ultimate healer; petals, water, and the sun were divine gifts from which humanity could summon long-lasting peace. They were both hippies at heart. Perfect Angel would be Riperton’s brightest moment. With Wonder’s backing band, Wonderlove, at the helm, the album felt bold and robust. Compared with Come to My Garden’s jazz arrangements and operatic elegance, Angel combined a lush blend of funk, reggae, folk, and soul. Riperton sounded more assertive than ever on opener “Reasons,” a strong mission statement with a brazen rock sound. It showed right away that Riperton had grown, that she was a budding star coming into her own. The first of three planned singles, “Reasons” saw marginal success on the radio, as did subsequent singles “Take a Little Trip” and “Seeing You This Way.” But they showed a different side of Riperton, as did the steamy “Every Time He Comes Around.” Never before had the vocalist been so sensuous in her music. Other standouts included “The Edge of a Dream”—which, according to Rudolph, was partially inspired by the civil rights activism of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.—and “Perfect Angel,” which was written by Wonder. Then there was “Lovin’ You,” a sweet, acoustic lullaby that Riperton delivers wistfully. It became the album’s biggest single and Riperton’s most recognized song ever. Listening to it today, “Lovin’ You” still feels remarkably affectionate, and offers the best example of her famed five-and-a-half-octave vocal range; when you think of Riperton, you remember that voice, a dynamic, heart-rendering instrument that imparts love, caring, and tender romanticism in equal measure. Of the alternate versions on Perfect Angel’s deluxe edition, the band rendition—with Wonder on Rhodes, Ollie Brown on drums, and Reggie McBride on bass—gives “Lovin’ You” a completely different sound, full of rolling basslines and floating keys steeped in Brazilian jazz. The second disc of this reissue offers a nice glimpse into how Perfect Angel was compiled, complete with studio chatter and extended jam sessions that make this great album even greater. We hear Riperton and Wonder tinker with the pace of “Seeing You This Way,” and Wonder’s sheer delight as the extended mix of “Perfect Angel” fades to a close. While these details could be considered small in the grander scheme of the recording, they speak directly to the joy that was captured on this LP. They offer peeks under the hood, showing us that the musicians not only created a masterful record but also had fun doing it together. Also on the second disc, album closer “Our Lives” is stretched beyond the nine-minute mark, carried by a layered funk groove and Wonder’s signature harmonica. The song feels moving and sad when reexamined now. Here, Riperton looked ahead to old age, when she and Rudolph could celebrate each other and the growth of their children. “Side by side, in the sun,” she sang, “we will build the world we’re after.” Near the end of the second verse, as Riperton reached the top of her range, she let out a soft “I love you,” that—when coupled with Wonder’s chilling chords—feels especially haunting. “During our time in Florida, Minnie and I were together all the time,” Rudolph writes in the new liner notes. “We were consumed with each other. We used our feelings as jumping off points to write songs like this one.” Riperton died long before her vision of the future could materialize. Though she’d release three more albums before her passing, Perfect Angel caught lightning in a bottle, and presented Riperton at her creative apex. Riperton set a precedent for artists like Erykah Badu and Moses Sumney, whose respective strains of soul and folk draw a direct line to her free-spirited ethos. You hear the legend’s hushed tranquility on new songs like Sumney’s “Doomed” and throughout the ’70s-inspired funk-soul hybrid of Badu’s 2000 album, Mama’s Gun. Samples of Riperton’s music can be heard across many rap songs, from A Tribe Called Quest and Black Star to J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar. Her iconic stature was cemented on Perfect Angel—43 years on, it has become a record for the ages. In what would’ve been her 70th year of life, Riperton continues to fill the world with magic.",9
"7","Everyday Is Christmas","Sia",0,"December 5 2017","Pop/R&B","Sia’s shiny Christmas album feels inconsistent and underwritten, like opening a gift where someone’s forgotten to remove the tags. Ever since Sia transitioned from “Six Feet Under” coffeeshop songwriter to Top 40 fixture, her career has contained the tension between the writer she’s trained as and the pop star she’s become. Specifically, she has a habit of giving smart, bluntly candid interviews in songwriter mode that are, in pop mode, the exact wrong thing to say. A Billboard interview where she mentioned the “victim to victory” songwriting template of tracks like “Titanium” was thrown back at her, in the headline of a New York Times pan of This Is Acting and countless other reviews. So what was it like writing her first Christmas album? “[There’s a] shortage of good Christmas music… It's not like you have to have an original idea to begin with,” Sia told Zane Lowe. “It's like, Christmas, mistletoe, ho-ho-ho, Santa Claus, Christmas list, elves.” This is technically accurate, in the way that a professional elf might accurately describe Christmas gift-giving as “like, hammer, nails, molds, wrapping paper.” But it also kind of grinches up the business. Of course, there’s no shortage of existing Christmas songs—virtually every musician records them as a quick stocking-stuffer for music blogs and streaming sites—but most of them are strictly for diehard fans. As far as canonical Christmas songs, the past few decades have produced basically only two. There’s the “All I Want for Christmas Is You” school: festive (or “Extra Festive” or “SuperFestive!”, as Mariah Carey dubbed the re-recordings of her hit) and infectious, in both senses of the word. Then there’s the “Last Christmas” school, where Christmas is an incidental setting for smaller human dramas. There’s plenty of room for variation here, from the downright morose original versions of “White Christmas” and “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” to the acid-dipped tinsel of Dragonette’s “Merry Xmas (Says Your Text Message),” to the sumptuous femme-fatale drama of Saint Etienne’s “No Cure for the Common Christmas,” to the infinite takes on Wham!’s original. The latter’s also closest to Sia’s non-holiday music, where big pop songs like “Chandelier” are infused with an underlying darkness. It’s a strange choice, then, that Everyday Is Christmas is mostly played straight. Like Kelly Clarkson’s Wrapped in Red, the album was produced by Greg Kurstin, and his trademark shiny production becomes DEFCON 1 festive. “Candy Cane Lane” is colorful and lightweight. “Santa’s Coming for You” has an ironic title, but the only threat is being smothered by Christmas cheer. There are some lovely ballads, such as the lilting, “Unchained Melody”-esque “Snowman” and its sister light-jazz track “Snowflake” (only kind of ruined by the news of 2017 discoursing the word into oblivion), which linger on the season’s impermanence. But they’re the same metaphor, so the effect is muted by sequencing them right next to each other—or anywhere close to “Puppies Are Forever,” the sonic equivalent of having the Christmas stuffing squeezed out of you by a rictus-grinned Elmyra Duff. There’s plenty Sia could do with an album entirely of Christmas originals, but too many are underwritten; there’s more consistency in the art direction than the songwriting. “Underneath the Mistletoe” flirts with being candid about an obsessive holiday crush—“it’s Christmas time, so run for your life”—but abandons the idea almost immediately. Half of “Ho Ho Ho” wants to be a Christmas misfits’ anthem; the other half wants to be a Christmas version of “Chandelier,” with lots of booze, nothing to lose. The production, vaguely festive and vaguely pop-skanky, doesn’t commit to either. Sia’s got a self-own for this, too: “It was easy and fun. We did it in two weeks.” Of course, plenty of great albums were secretly written in two weeks, just like plenty of fine presents were secretly purchased on the eve of December 24. But it’s still like opening a gift where someone’s forgotten to remove the tags.",5.8
"8","Zaytown Sorority Class of 2017","Zaytoven",0,"December 5 2017","Rap","The prolific Atlanta producer enlists 17 women for an all-female mixtape that is well-intentioned and occasionally delightful, but doesn't have enough highlights to sustain its momentum. Women rappers so rarely get their due. The barrier to entry has always been much higher, expectations have been unreasonably harsh, and even at the top level, there is intolerance: Rarely have two women have ever been able to dominate hip-hop culture at the same time. There can only be one, if any, and there’s even less room for queer and trans women. The last few years have shown promise, providing glimpses of what the future could hold: Cardi B topped the charts with her strutting single “Bodak Yellow,” becoming the first woman in rap to do so since Lauryn Hill in 1998, longtime indie rap workhorse Rapsody was nominated for Best Rap Album at the Grammys, and upstarts like Kamaiyah, Dreezy, and Kodie Shane continue to rise. The obvious goal is for women rappers not to be judged solely by their female peers but as rappers period. The obstacles to that are clear: patriarchy, resource imbalances, fewer signings, misconceptions about a talent gap between women rappers and their male counterparts, and constant suspicion from skeptics who believe even the best women MCs have their rap's written for them by men. Prolific Atlanta pianist and beat guru Zaytoven is aware of these discrepancies, and in 2014 he released his Zaytown Sorority mixtape, which spotlit unheralded women in rap. The 17-track second installment focuses on his Class of 2017, returning some old guests, introducing a few new ones, and adding some more star power into the mix. Zaytown Sorority 2 features seasoned charmers of yesteryear Trina and Khia, buzzing would-be stars like Dej Loaf and Kash Doll, “Love & Hip-Hop: Atlanta” cast members Joseline Hernandez, Tiffany Foxx, PreMadonna, and Jessica Dime, and a cadre of lesser-known rappers like Ms. GoHam and Chella H. While the tape is well-intentioned and occasionally delightful, there aren’t enough highlights to sustain momentum. Rapper showcases like this one rarely produce more than mixed results. Even the all-star lineups tend to suffer from a free-for-all aimlessness, as any DJ Khaled album proves. The primary objective is exposure, not curation. On Zaytown Sorority Vol. 2, these fluctuations in quality are compounded by the varying caliber of the MCs enlisted, who range from savvy veterans with commanding presences to amateurs just finding their bearings. Some rappers deliver one-off outtakes, others submit resumes. Accomplished artists clash with MCs in the developmental stages. There is a disparity between talented rappers who understand the lack of stakes and mail it in and enthusiastic underachievers. Form should follow function, particularly on a release like this that lays its intent out so plainly; yet, the product presented doesn’t honor the ambitions. The mixtape opens with a bang, with its most charismatic personalities and most forceful rappers, before quickly tapering off in its middle section. Zay front loads the heavy hitters, with Trina and Khia doing decent impressions of their past work. Dej, who is among the most clever writers in rap today, shines brightest on “How It Feel,” her bubbly singsong raps carrying on their own buoyancy, each gummy pronunciation betraying her hard-nosed stunt raps. She can’t be bothered in her songs, which plays especially well under these circumstances. “I thank god, I’m in my right mind now/Money in the stash/Put them hundreds on timeout,” she raps casually, creating unusual imagery. On “Supersize,” Kash Doll doesn’t so much rap as swagger through, repeating lines until they fade before suddenly delivering a combo like, “Put a fuckboi on the bench if he got sidelines/Nigga tried to kill the cat but it got nine lives” with an unnerving sense of ease. Outside of these highlights delivered by clearcut standouts, Zaytown Sorority Vol. 2 does feature some solid showings for a few of the lesser known artists showcased, like Ms. GoHam on “Never Have I Ever” and Tiffany Bleu on “Smile,” but many of these are followed or preceded by a clunker. The melodies on Shanell and Princess’ “Get It Up,” a song about erectile dysfunction, fall flat. Qu Da Queen and Robyn Fly’s “Automatic” is repetitive and grating. Jessica Dime is just one of a few guests who mimic Gucci Mane cadences, but the punches are less effective. When Gucci uses his drawl to lurch through schemes he builds up steam into a big, unforgettable one-liner, and there’s none of that impact on “Shrimp.” Though the mixtape’s quality shifts wildly from song to song, Zaytoven’s icy, keyboard-driven production holds the project together at the seams. He is consistently great, giving the ladies of his sorority class with some of his finest compositions. Zaytown Sorority Vol. 2 isn’t the superb, woman-focused compilation rap needs, but the tape continues the long, unavoidable conversation rap gatekeepers and fans must have about representation.",6.2
"9","Songs of Experience","U2",0,"December 4 2017","Rock","Years in the making, U2’s 14th studio album finds the band straining to reassert its relevance in a world where rock music has long since ceded its vanguard status. In the late 1980s, en route to Memphis on the mission that would be dubiously immortalized by the documentary U2: Rattle and Hum, Bono hitched a ride with a stranger whose car stereo dashed his spirits. The young driver had been listening to Def Leppard’s Mutt Lange-produced glam-metal opus Hysteria—and it sounded magnificent. Bono was awed. When at last it dawned on the driver who exactly he’d picked up, he switched out the Def Leppard tape for some vintage U2. By comparison, it couldn’t help but sound dull. “I think we were a little out of touch,” Bono reflected later, having heard what U2 lacked. “We weren’t as great as we figured we were.” It is hard to believe that U2 were galvanized to write Achtung Baby! by a chance encounter with “Pour Some Sugar on Me” on cassette. But then that’s U2: Their art is fundamentally, inveterately emulous. The pursuit of relevance seems above all what motivates them to create. What are they doing, really, when time and again they endeavor to reinvent themselves, if not trying to remain fashionable—or, more precisely, to stave off obsolescence? In 1989, drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. told Bono he worried the band was “turning into the world’s most expensive jukebox.” The band could not abide it. “They became so bored playing U2’s greatest hits that one night they went out and played the whole set backward,” Bill Flanagan writes in his biography U2 at the End of the World. “It didn’t seem to make any difference.” It’s this inclination toward boredom and restlessness that has always secretly been U2’s animating force. The fear of seeming “a little out of touch”: Nearly 30 years after Bono declared on stage that the band had to “go away and dream it all up again,” this is still the prime creative catalyst. And on Songs of Experience, U2’s 14th studio album, the anxiety is more apparent than ever. Bono, it seems, has been spending a lot of time around a lot of strangers’ car stereos, and what he’s concluded U2 lacks he’s undertaken resolutely to embrace. Behold the album’s many hallmarks of the modern: There are contributions by Kendrick Lamar (“American Soul”) and Haim (“Lights of Home”), and there are flourishes that conspicuously recall the xx (“Red Flag Day”) and Arcade Fire (“Get Out of Your Own Way”). Opening track “Love Is All We Have Left” invokes a distinctly Justin Vernon-ish vocoder, an homage we might dub “Bono Iver.” And “Summer of Love”—on which Bono croons “I been thinkin’ ‘bout the West Coast/Not the one that everyone knows”—suggests someone just discovered Born to Die. Bono and the Edge have said that lately, innovation has been less evident in rock music than elsewhere—in “R&B, hip-hop, and pop,” according to a profile of the band in the New York Times. This academic interest in other genres is manifest across Songs of Experience. It’s clear in the subwoofer-trashing bass that undergirds “The Blackout,” the liveliest Adam Clayton has sounded in ages. It’s clear in the thick slabs of lurid distortion that course through “American Soul,” which last appeared, in much different form, as “XXX” on Kendrick’s DAMN. And it’s clear in the sumptuous, waterlogged beat that concludes the final track, “13 (There Is a Light),” reminiscent of Noah “40” Shebib and his legions of imitators. These are brazen attempts to capture the zeitgeist, even by U2’s standards. Their combined effect is dire: Songs of Experience is the shameless effort of four men in their late 50s to muster a contemporary, youthful sound. Of course, the band’s aspirations toward relevance are tempered by a competing pursuit: Here they strive, as usual, to guarantee longevity. They want to seem in touch; they also want to canonize another classic. This, one presumes, accounts for the inclusion of more familiar-sounding U2 barn-burners such as “Love Is Bigger Than Anything in its Way,” which sounds almost exactly like one expects a U2 song with that title would, and lead single “You’re the Best Thing About Me,” which has already failed to take hold of the popular imagination. “The problem with rock now is that it’s trying to be cool,” Bono said recently. “But clear thoughts and big melodies—if they come from a true place, they not only capture the instant, they become eternal in a way.” The Edge, meanwhile, said the band was concerned with whether these songs would “be played by people in a bar in 25 years.” Well, Songs of Experience does not much “capture the instant,” hunger to as it might, and it is safe to assume that while, say, “Pride (In the Name of Love)” or “New Year’s Day” have proven something like timeless, “Red Flag Day” and “The Showman (Little More Better)” will fall rather short of eternal. “How long must we sing this song?” Bono asked on “Sunday Bloody Sunday”—and they’ve been obliged to sing it nightly since 1983. With these songs, about a single tour should do. Despite the blatant bid to sound modish and rejuvenated, U2 cannot help in certain respects but sound the same. Bono still writes Bono-brand howlers: He still lapses into prosaic platitudes (“Are you tough enough to be kind?/Do you know your heart has its own mind?”), moony cliche (“Free yourself to be yourself/If only you could see yourself”), and arena-rock patois (“You! Are! Rock’n’roll!”—the “you” there is America, naturally). Politics are addressed in earnest, to ludicrously ill-judged effect. Which is more vicariously embarrassing: the stretch of “Red Flag Day” that contrasts a tryst on the beaches of the Mediterranean with the deaths of Syrian refugees (“Baby let’s get in the water… so many lost in the sea last night”), or the portmanteau punchline that ends “American Soul,” which is simply: “refujesus”? It is tempting to praise Songs of Experience on the basis of its mawkish wholeheartedness. It does indeed seem like the product of considerable toil: This thing has been in progress for something like three years now, and between its revisions, reconstructions, and post-election rewritings, it plainly benefits from more attention and effort than any U2 album since All That You Can’t Leave Behind. But it’s precisely this manifest ambition that makes Songs of Experience dispiriting. The music itself isn’t any better merely because this time around the band actually cares; all the industrious fervor amounts to meager flailing. It’s one thing to fail when you’re phoning it in: You leave hope that you could pull it off if only you tried. It’s quite another to fail when you’re giving it everything.",5.3
"10","Post Self","Godflesh",0,"December 4 2017","Metal","The new LP from pioneering industrial band Godflesh is the duo’s best effort in over 20 years—a sinister amalgam of Justin Broadrick and G.C. Green’s collective work to date. “We understand the ordinary business of living, we know how to work the machine,” T.S. Eliot wrote in 1939’s “The Family Reunion.” “We are insured against fire, against larceny and illness, against defective plumbing, but not against the act of God.” Eliot’s play was a disaster, but it well illustrates the binaries written right into the name of pioneering industrial band Godflesh. Since the duo’s formation in 1988, their artistic underpinnings have encompassed human screams and assembly-line roars, hot blood and cold steel, the devil we know and the android we fear. Multi-instrumentalist Justin Broadrick and bassist G.C. Green weren’t the first in heavy music to exploit these binaries through unbridled aggression; Killing Joke, Throbbing Gristle, and Einstürzende Neubauten are but three iconic groups that were active long before Godflesh. But in matters of sheer sonic magnitude, Godflesh’s juncture of man-made instrumentation (searing shouts, buzzsaw riffs) and artificial fury (militant drum loops, chrome-laden effects) was unprecedented upon arrival. Three decades, six albums, and one 13-year hiatus later, Godflesh remain revered—and what’s more, they keep getting better. Post Self, the duo’s eighth LP and third release since reconvening in 2014, is easily the group’s best effort in over 20 years, not to mention 2017’s best industrial-metal album. Whereas the preceding A World Lit Only By Fire functioned primarily as a reintroduction to Godflesh’s primordial rage, Post Self represents a sinister amalgam of its creators’ greater body of work, especially Broadrick’s ambient project Jesu. Broadrick and Green have tinkered with the scale of their musical modi operandi over the years, but they’ve kept their building blocks consistent. Broadrick’s drum machines and Green’s gnarled, rubbery bass riffs supply the music’s driving engine as well as its primary source of order, a rhythmic buffer against Broadrick’s animalistic grunts. Godflesh’s factory-floor soundscapes prove hostile and inhuman. “Be God” and “No Body” find Broadrick playing Iron Man’s murderous cousin, his full-throated bark distorted beyond recognition. “In Your Shadow” takes the mechanical suffocation even further, with vocals so compressed and static-ridden, you can’t help but wonder if the man moonlights as a Dalek. Post Self’s violent detachment from the world of the living are certainly attention-grabbing, and on songs like “Parasite” and the title track, even ear-pleasing. But the disturbing ghosts haunting Godflesh’s machine aren’t as simple, or as static, as they seem. “Mirror of Finite Light” lights up the darkness with a shoegaze-y arc flash straight out of the Jesu playbook, awash in textured synths and hazy drone. “The Infinite End,” the LP’s closer, explores this liminality to majestic effect, condensing light and shadow down to a single, sublime point, like the Big Bang in reverse. Brisk, 47-minute runtime aside, Post Self is a daunting listen, as well as an essential one, even by Godflesh’s sterling standards. Broadrick and Green’s brutal alchemy has never felt more prescient in our current age of backflipping robots and—if inventor Elon Musk’s predictions hold true—global wars sparked by AI. If we’re barrelling straight towards the point of singularity, we might as well go out with speakers blaring. And we’d be hard pressed to find better sonic guides than Godflesh, industrial-metal’s most trusted duo, to carry us to the inevitable end.",8.1
"11","cybersex","blackbear",0,"December 4 2017","Rap","With a long bench of guests from 2 Chainz to Ne-Yo, the singer’s fourth album is sometimes catchy but astonishingly hollow and derivative. The singer, songwriter, and producer known as blackbear is devoted to brands; it’s one of many ways in which he’s old-fashioned. The songs on his new album cybersex, released sure enough on Cyber Monday (his 27th birthday) bristle with product mentions. There are spots for Gucci, Timberland and, blackbear’s potential favorite, Wilhelmina Models, whom he brags on “Thursday/Froze Over (“Interlude”)” about sharing carnally with G-Eazy (another example of the artist’s inherent conservatism is his unrepentant, unblinking misogyny.) His interviews, even the ones conducted by phone, come with a monotonous, Patrick Bateman-esque recitation of what he was wearing as he discussed how little he cared about music. You imagine his publicist sending multiple emails to the reporters: “Don’t forget, you said you’d include that he had on a…yep…yep, it’s spelled R-A-F…” cybersex is blackbear’s fourth full length, but it’s the first that he’s released since signing what he touted as a $10 million deal with Interscope and the project has all the bells and whistles of the industry playing catch-up with a genuinely new sound. His talents are for melody, mimicry, and self-promotion and he has marketed himself as a polished answer to what critics have called SoundCloud rap. cybersex scans as a major label affair, with a bloated 14-song, 51 minute tracklist, shiny Rap&B hooks scattered chaotically like glitter on hotel bedsheets. The record has a dream list of features for someone whose teenage years coincided with the death of blogroll-rap. Appearances, some energized, some dutiful, are made by Cam’ron, Paul Wall, T-Pain, Rick Ross and Ne-Yo, among others. Ne-Yo and blackbear have known each other for a third of the younger man’s life, since he was releasing music as Mat Musto (he was born Matthew Musto). Their meeting marked the beginning of the near-decade that blackbear has spent termiting his way in and around the industry. His writing assist on the 2012 Justin Bieber hit “Girlfriend” granted him insider cred and his prolificacy, social media presence and nose for fashion trends did the rest. His explosive popularity, seeded by his 2015 record Deadroses and several appearances on Kylie Jenner’s snapchat, culminated this year with the Gucci Mane-featuring hit “Do Re Mi” and a burst of tabloid coverage linking him with the actress Bella Thorne. As a public figure, blackbear is so objectionable in his self-pity, mean-spiritedness, and obliviousness—after Lil Peep’s death in November he criticized the 21-year-old as a swagger-jacker who glorified drugs—that it’s tempting to dismiss his music on the basis of the lyrics alone, which can’t help but to reveal those qualities. But there are germs of musical talent in evidence on cybersex, particularly on a string of R&B songs that display his melodic abilities. The first of these is “Playboy S**t” but the best is the Ne-Yo feature, “Top Priority,” a sweetly sung, inescapably catchy R&B song that features the mentor in A+ vintage form, as he serenades his old flame, Ms. Independent. There are fewer rap songs and they are significantly weaker. On several, blackbear and his featured guest (Rick Ross, Cam’ron) seem to expect each other to carry the weight and the results (“Glo_Up,” “Bright Pink Tims”) sound like a dresser being dropped down a flight of stairs. Even on the stronger tracks, blackbear’s lack of originality is near stunning. “Top Priority” shamelessly rehashes the “ho to housewife” trope and the high-point of “Gucci Linen,” outside of the 2 Chainz verse, is a hook which references Nelly Furtado’s 2001 hit “I’m Like a Bird” and Nelly’s 2002 hit “Hot in Herre.” Then, there are the lyrics and boy, are they awful. “Thursday/Froze Over” begins with a recitation of the most famous men who have had sex with the same women as blackbear, who, along with the aforementioned G-Eazy, apparently include Bieber and Bruno Mars. On “I Hope Your Whole Life Sux,” women are compared to foodstuffs—“Instagram be feeling like the grocery store I pick and choose”—and on “Candayapple,” he boasts of a companion that “She my accessory, you know that ima flaunt her.” These sentiments are a natural outgrowth of vibes expressed on Drake’s Take Care and in the Weeknd’s entire discography. blackbear appears to have studied both artists closely and, like the two Canadians, his melodic gifts will yield a handful of hits—“Down 4 U,” the T-Pain feature on cybersex, might be a contender. But unlike Drake or Abel Tesfaye, blackbear has little interest in perfecting his music, exploring new sounds, or earning pop stardom; he has repeatedly told interviewers that he plans to quit within the next couple of years. “Music’s a hobby to me,” he said to Noisey. “I have stocks and bitcoins, I consult for things and whatever, I dress girls for Coachella.” His lack of investment helps explain why listening to cybersex feels the way it does. Initially appealing and often catchy, it reveals itself relatively quickly as a shallow record made by an emotional idiot, stocked with brand names and old ideas, signifying nothing.",4.1
"12","Endless Computer","Expander",0,"December 4 2017","Metal","With their vicious debut LP, Austin quartet Expander ascend to the Texas thrash pantheon, evoking familiar metal-punk sounds as well as dystopian sci-fi themes. Describing themselves as “timezapped neuropunks,” Austin thrash quartet Expander take on the image of space pirates who have seen the future and left it behind. They draw upon Voivod’s dystopian science fiction themes and the metal-punk of fellow Austin band Impalers, as well as the punkier side of West Coast metal polymaths VHÖL. With their Kurt Ballou-produced debut full-length Endless Computer, they have ascended to the Texas thrash pantheon alongside Iron Age and Power Trip. Expander forge a new path from familiar thrash elements and present them in an alienated context that is as hard-charging as it bewildered and contemplative. “Biochron Space Suit,” the opening track, is pretty much everything you want from a thrash track in 2017. There’s General Ham’s rabid snarl alongside Ballou’s feedback frays, tipping guitarist Guzzler’s razor-pointed riffing over the edge. Drummer Keymaster—the one clad in a cyborg bodysuit here—bashes away with hardcore ethos and learned finesse. “Biochron” is conscious of its ripping, and it makes no bones about proving its case to you. “R-Type 2 Civilization,” with a noise-rock flair from Swirly’s bass that is equal parts Motörhead boogie and Repulsion racket, is just as furious. In all their portrayal of humans subjected to machinery, Expander prove to be quite flexible and nimble. With that, Endless Computer recalls classic death metal’s cerebral attitude despite having little death metal influence, tearing through a psychedelic hellspawn without frill. Its progressive undertones are much less stated than something like Master of Puppets or Rust in Peace, with Guzzler opting for subtler tics that don’t get swallowed up in Endless Computer’s unrelenting fury. Many great metal records in this decade honor metal tradition with small tweaks, subtle subversions, and homages of spirit. Expander presents the future as the past reconfigured, the same shell with a new, deadlier heart. Every Tom G. Warrior “UGH!” that General Ham yells is a tribute—yet they also sound like a human gazing, in awe, into a cold, mechanized world. Guzzler, meanwhile, unleashes loads of catchy crossover riffs. He’s an efficient guitarist who presents a linear path to the pit—it’s just there are many of these paths, and they’re going by at a blinding pace. Expander can be difficult to keep up with. “Cold Orbit” is constantly heading toward self-destruction, and “Timezapped” is so hectic that a lurching wah-wah towards the end doesn’t stop it from barreling recklessly ahead. Even the title track, with a bouncy central riff that also draws from early Voivod and Motörhead, feels trapped in a whirlwind purgatory, with General Ham sounding at his most pained, only dreaming of running free. “Authority Spire” takes that torture and amplifies it, centering more on Guzzler’s black metal tremolo explorations that sprout throughout the record. Pain for pleasure is integral to metal; Expander puts a technological existentialism to it, pumping you with enough riff information to give you too much of everything you want. Ballou consistently gets the heaviest tones from bands, and here, he gets Expander to think bigger, to derive unity from chaos. This is a stark contrast to most of the lo-fi black metal and esoteric death metal released on label Nuclear War Now!, a sugar shock that has no sweetness. Power Trip’s Nightmare Logic isn’t the only thrash record or Texas record that functions as a broad State of Metal this year: Endless Computer is just as vicious and forward-thinking, and it’s got an even bleaker look at the future. It suggests that our technology will become too much to bear, and we will be the ones to cause that. But despite its overarching despair, Endless Computer contains a tinge of optimism in presenting Expander as one of the best young metal bands to emerge this year.",7.8
"13","Metal Machine Music","Lou Reed",0,"December 3 2017","Rock","Lou Reed’s 1975 album has been called one of the worst albums ever made. The truth is it is the product of genuine love and passion, still exhilarating and bursting with possibility four decades on. It’s all there in the first minute: there’s a low-mid whoosh that’s clearly guitar feedback, like a Jimi Hendrix power chord trailing off; there’s a bit of an electric rattle, perhaps a fluttering speaker cone gasping for air; then come the high-pitched screeches, perhaps bringing to mind a grainy video image of seagulls circling over an open sea filled with radioactive garbage. From there, a ringing squall is folded in, an unstable mess of harmonics that shudders and quakes like nerve impulses curling down a human spine. And with that, we’re deep into Lou Reed’s Metal Machine Music. For a good 15 years after its 1975 release, Metal Machine Music, a double album of avant-garde noise put out by a rock legend who was only starting to get his commercial due, was discussed as a gesture more than as music. Explanations for its existence proliferated. Some said it was Lou Reed’s attempt to get out of a record contract, or a fuck-you to fans who only wanted to hear his most popular songs. Or it was mis-packaged, maybe, and was originally supposed to come out on a classical label, where there was some precedence for this kind of experiment. And some of these rumors about Metal Machine Music’s troubled release were started, or at least encouraged, by Reed himself. Reed put out MMM at a precarious moment in his career, with VU firmly in the rearview but his own commercial prospects unclear. His 1972 debut solo album made almost no impact, but the David Bowie-produced Transformer fared much better with the rise of glam rock and the commercial success of the single “Walk on the Wild Side.” Though Reed followed that album with a poorly received commercial bomb (1973’s Berlin, now considered a theatrical rock classic), his profile in the rock world continued to climb through ’74 and ’75, and his past suddenly had currency. The Velvet Underground vault recording 1969 Velvet Underground Live with Lou Reed appeared in 1974, and the successful live solo album from earlier the same year, Rock ‘n’ Roll Animal, was heavy on glammed-up versions of VU songs. Sally Can’t Dance wasn’t one of Reed’s better albums, but the title song got some FM radio play, and the LP hit the Top 10. Given his dicey commercial prospects at the beginning of the decade, Reed could, by mid–1975, be called a successful rock star. Which explains why his next choice was so baffling. Metal Machine Music is shrouded in mystery in part because Lou Reed made it alone. The nature of the music didn’t require a studio or an engineer, so he recorded it by himself at his Manhattan loft, working late into the night. Though he put a long series of instruments, filters, and technical specifications on the back cover of the record (“Ring Modulator/Octave Relay Jump”; “Distortion 0.02 bass and treble ceilings”), little or none of it had anything to do with the recording. The notes were a prank. The actual recording involved just a couple of amps and guitars with open tunings leaning against them, a few microphones, and a tape machine. When an amp is turned up, the vibration of the sound will stimulate the strings and pickups of a nearby guitar, generating what we all recognize as feedback. The harmonic information of the feedback will have a particular quality that varies along with the tunings, and with two guitars occupying the same space, the interactions between the instruments can create additional harmonics. Reed experimented with settings and guitar placements and then mixed the results into four separate 16-minute pieces, each of which has completely different information happening in each stereo channel. Reed’s state of mind and thought process during the recording are not known, since there was no one else around during the recording and Reed himself, addled by chronic abuse of methamphetamine, served as an unreliable narrator (in his biography Lou Reed: A Life, Anthony DeCurtis called MMM a “hymn to speed”). All of which left an opening for stories to proliferate. In Victor Bockris’ book Transformer, Reed is quoted as saying “I put out Metal Machine Music precisely to put a stop to all of it. It was a giant fuck-you. I wanted to clear the air and get rid of all those fucking assholes who show up and yell ‘Vicious’ and ‘Walk on the Wild Side.’” But Reed’s “fuck-you” was more of a defense mechanism. He clearly knew the album would cause a ruckus and some of his actions were antagonistic provocations, such as the legendary liner notes, alternately boastful and incoherent, where he says, “Most of you won’t like this, and I don’t blame you at all. It’s not meant for you.” But deep down, in the heart he protected at all costs and showed to the world only when he was ready, he adored this music. Metal Machine Music was, for him, a perfect recording, taking his love of noise and drone and musical chaos to its logical endpoint.  In 2007, Reed told Pitchfork, “The myth is sort of better than the truth. The myth is that I made it to get out of a recording contract. OK, but the truth is that I wouldn’t do that, because I wouldn’t want you to buy a record that I didn’t really like, that I was just trying to do a legal thing with. I wouldn’t do something like that. The truth is that I really, really, really loved it.” During the mid–1970s, Reed famously sparred in print with Lester Bangs, a Velvet Underground superfan who thought Reed was wasting his talent with his new music and was perfectly willing to tell him so to his face. Reed v. Bangs was the Fischer v. Spassky of the rock press’ golden era, two masters in their respective fields matching each other move-for-move. Two key Bangs articles capture Reed during the period. “Let Us Now Praise Famous Death Dwarves” from the March 1975 issue of Creem, is among Bangs’ most famous pieces, and finds him and Reed, both drunk and drug-addled, basically screaming at each other as Bangs tries to get behind the rock star pose. “The Greatest Album Ever Made,” in the March ’76 issue, finds Bangs grappling with Metal Machine Music. The title of Bangs’ Metal Machine Music piece is ironic, though Bangs clearly loved the music. The fact that he couches genuine appreciation in a series of jokes about the record shows that a critical language for appreciating the album didn’t exist in 1975. Even people who might have loved it (and there are very few accounts of anyone praising it at the time, other than Bangs) didn’t know how to explain why it might be good. At the time, with MMM considered only as “the new Lou Reed album,” it was met with confusion and derision.  Some writers, like John Rockwell for the New York Times, took the record seriously and tried to evaluate it on its own merits, but came away puzzled. Writing in the Boston Globe, William Howard called it “An appalling rip-off.” In their year-end poll, Rolling Stone called it the “Worst Album by a Human Being.” The record initially sold about 100,000 copies, making it what has to be the best-selling noise music album of all time, but a great many of those copies were quickly returned, and the record was almost immediately removed from stores. After that initial wave of press and puzzlement, Metal Machine Music was, for many years, mostly forgotten, trotted out periodically for a “worst music of all time” list. Since it didn’t make the ’80s transition to CD (there was no reason to put it out) it was barely on the radar at all. MMM had become just part of rock lore, a record you heard about, not one you actually heard. But something started to happen to Metal Machine Music over time: a context for understanding and appreciating it began to build up around it. Sonic Youth, the unimpeachable aesthetic conscience of the ’80s, were inspired by the album (you can see the wheels turning in a photo of a rapt teenaged Thurston Moore communing with his copy). Noise was in the air. In 1991, Neil Young, also beloved by Sonic Youth, put out a live album called Arc, which consisted mostly of 35 minutes of edited feedback and noise. In 1998, Sonic Youth themselves put out an album called Silver Session (For Jason Knuth) that could be heard as a “cover” of Metal Machine Music, as it was created with a room full of amps and guitars in the throes of feedback. Extreme music from Japan, led by Masami Akita’s project Merzbow, brought harsh sounds to the CD racks, many of which sounded uncannily derived from MMM. Record collectors with turntables found used vinyl copies of MMM which had never been terribly scarce given the album’s initially huge rate of return. In 2000, Metal Machine Music was properly issued on CD, with liner notes from Rolling Stone critic David Fricke.  And in the final decade of Reed’s life, he performed variations of the core idea of the record as Metal Machine Trio, and the work was scored for acoustic instruments and recorded by the experimental classical ensemble Zeitkratzer. Reed always said it would find its place, and he was right. Reed has said he made Metal Machine Music for himself, and indulgence is baked into the concept. It’s the sound of electricity falling in love with itself, utterly relentless, a blast of energy that never lets up. On a casual listen, it seems static, like it’s only doing one thing. But the album constantly changes and is never the same from one second to the next. If you hear the music as placid, which is possible at lower volumes, it’s like a waterfall, endless particles of sound-matter crashing down and never landing in the same way twice. If you hear it as violent, which is also possible, it’s like an explosion that’s constantly at the moment of its concussive peak, one that never quite completes itself. The key to understanding MMM is its physicality. Reed has underscored its connection to the body, which gives it a “functional” utility that separates it from the more cerebral end of experimental composition. He’s right that it’s best experienced on headphones, not just because of the extreme panning but because very few people have a living situation that allows them to blast an hour of noise music over speakers. To walk the streets with MMM playing loudly in your headphones is to bring focus to the present moment. You can feel your pulse quickening slightly because the noise triggers an alert in your body, but you then realize that when your nerves say “danger,” they’re not always correct. And the hormonal release that comes from experiencing noise can, if you pause to feel it, focus the mind. “It’s impossible to even think when the thing is on,” Reed said in Transformer. “It destroys you. You can’t complete a thought.” You see things and can isolate their shapes and colors while your ears are otherwise engaged in processing this overwhelming abstraction. And part of the masochistic excitement of the record when you listen to it loud is that it not only sounds like something that will damage your hearing, it’s the sound of the damage itself (warning: don't listen to it loud for long). MMM’s greatest conceptual tweak might be the fact that it both has “an ending” and never ends. After 64 minutes of punishing noise that steers clear of melody and steady rhythm, a bassy rumble enters in its final seconds that sounds almost like percussion. It’s at this instant that the album slips into the circular locked groove created by mastering engineer Bob Ludwig. That rumble, now as fixed and tight enough for a rhythm track sample, goes around and around for as long as you want it to. If you have the vinyl, you can continue to listen to MMM as long as you like, that one bit of sound spinning round and round forever, it's beautiful, and it’s been playing for about 12 minutes as I write this now.",8.7
"14","Master of Puppets","Metallica",1,"December 2 2017","Metal","Best new reissue In 1986, Metallica released inarguably one of the best metal records of all time. Newly remastered with live takes and demos, the album’s riffs, power, and mania remain as potent as ever. Before drummer Lars Ulrich even thought about acquiring Basquiats to auction off in the future, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett was most stoked on obtaining the first issue of the Fantastic Four comic, which established Marvel as a big name and is now estimated to be worth around $135,000. The unmitigated success of Master of Puppets, inarguably one of the greatest metal albums of all time, let him do that, and set him on a path from obtaining valuable pieces of pop culture to becoming an icon in the culture itself. When asked about why he wanted the rare comic, Hammett replied, “To obtain the unobtainable is a real rush in itself.” The lasting characteristics that took metal from its from heavier rock offshoot to its own distinct form were already taking shape by the time Metallica released their third album Master of Puppets in 1986. The Bay Area thrash scene where they originated—and quickly divested themselves from—was born from one of the most successful mergers in music: metal riffs and punk energy. Melody was increasingly prominent, bringing with it a wounded and raw beauty. Thrash also brought about an element of social consciousness, adding flourishes to British crust pioneers Discharge’s brute simplicity. Metal was both assimilated into pop culture and a bastion of musical expansion, a reimagination of progressive rock with more direct propulsion. It was music not content with its own alienation, ready to lash back as a big-tent alternative that demanded a deeper understanding. Will this reissue of Master of Puppets—a remastered and expanded box set, featuring studio outtakes and live performances from around the world and one of bassist Jason Newstead’s first shows at a club in Reseda, Cali.—convince you it’s the greatest metal record of all time, if you’re not convinced already? The numerous early takes and rough demos have a diehard appeal (there’s a reason Metallica has a dedicated archivist on their payroll), though the live recordings present a band going through its most monumental transition punctuated by monumental tragedy. Recording a masterpiece was the easy part. Genius does not appear out of thin air and Puppets was a culmination of Metallica’s influences and forward direction, so yes, it will give you a more rounded sense of how a masterwork came to be. That the early roughness stands starkly shows how relentless they were in making a defining metal record. Its predecessor, 1984’s Ride The Lightning, began with “Fight Fire With Fire,” a song fueled by nuclear paranoia, which was not at all uncommon in the ’80s. Puppets opens with “Battery,” a celebration of destruction as a liberating force, trading in commentary for a purely aspirational message, albeit one the heshers could revere. It’s basically “Fire” widened in philosophical scope and tightened in performance. In this way, Puppets wasn’t a radical break from Lightning. Both mostly follow a similar structure—acoustic intro, second song as title track, a “ballad” on the fourth song, a long instrumental—and yet Metallica were not copying themselves or refining their approach. They were crazy enough to think they could top Lightning, and they did. It’s what separated them from the rest of the thrash scene, and from most metal in general; they were the furthest thing from Def Leppard, but they wanted to push their own boundaries of metal as high art as much as Def Leppard was trying out-slick and out-pop their Los Angeles rivals. In hindsight, game recognize game. Metallica abandoned Los Angeles because they couldn’t hang with the pop bands there—all of those Decline of Civilization Part II Aqua Net rejects couldn’t fathom wanting to ascend to Metallica’s heights anyway. Puppets deals with the very nature of control, presenting the hangover of its allure. Metal is fight music for underdogs and while that is empowering and worthwhile, Puppets shows the consequences of control in the wrong hands. The title track was Hetfield warning himself about addiction, something he would become intimate with, and he wouldn’t listen until their 2004 tell-all documentary Some Kind of Monster made a tragic comedy out of Metallica’s near collapse while recording St. Anger. Through its raging rhythm and heart-wrenching valleys, where bassist Cliff Burton brought a distorted symphony of the mind, Hetfield’s pleas for sanity sure don’t sound like someone coming to grips with how fucked up he is. This isn’t unusual for cautionary drug songs, yet “Puppets” doesn’t sound like a morality play—“Master! Master!” is servitude delivered as arena unity, where you grow stronger, not indentured, by yelling it louder and louder. “Disposable Heroes” and “Leper Messiah” explore the illusion of control through more conventional topics—“Heroes” takes on war and “Messiah” skewers televangelists as any decent ’80s metal band would—and still manage to be more powerful than most bands at their best. Metallica embraced more complex structures without diluting themselves, a rare instance where a band gets more accessible by getting more complicated. Puppets’ fusion of beauty and savagery is best defined in its last two songs, “Orion,” an instrumental, and “Damage Inc.” Both tracks were co-written by Burton, effectively sealing his legacy that still looms over Metallica three decades later. His presence is strongest on “Orion,” making thrash move like ballet, a swelling motion that’s not just about crashing into things. The bridge takes the control motif and creates worlds with it, creating tenderness and majesty, showing what a man’s hand masquerading as divine can summon. “Orion” is celestial through meaning, not explicit text, Hawkwind’s high-mindedness combined with Lemmy’s more direct glance. “Damage Inc.” closes how “Battery” opened the album: reckless carnage as a cleansing, necessary fire. While it’s more of a contrast than fusion, they still coexist with a purpose to elevate metal. It’s even more apocalyptic than “Fight Fire With Fire”—there’s no mention of nuclear war, just a focus on getting mowed down for someone else’s survival. “Fuck it all, fucking no regrets” proved to be such an impactful line, Hetfield reused it again in 2003, on St. Anger’s title track with a teenager’s enthusiastic clumsiness. Nevertheless, Hetfield is, bar none, metal’s standout rhythm guitarist, handling blazing speed with a precision and heft. Metallica are so ubiquitous that this perhaps has gone under-recognized; hummable as his riffs are, and the legions of hummers massive, Hetfield’s role as frontman obscures his contributions as a guitarist. The rough mixes included in this deluxe reissue are mostly devoid of solos and vocals, and they become pantheons to Hetfield’s rhythm stature. It’s jarring to hear gaps where Hammett’s solos or Burton’s fills should be, and yet through him (and our collective memories) the songs still flow as they should. Hetfield-Hammett-Burton-Ulrich is one of the few metal lineups where every member was equally integral, where if you removed one, the band would be radically altered. Hetfield was the bond between everyone else, a ground to Burton’s ambitions and Hammett’s squalling lead work, a reason that Ulrich didn’t need to be flashy because he certainly couldn’t be. Puppets brought Metallica to their artistic climax, but its touring cycle proved a severe challenge to such loftiness. The live recordings here are closer to the tapes that Metallica made their reputation off of than the polished productions on the 1993 box set Live Shit: Binge & Purge, the cash-out from touring all corners of the globe. As demanding of perfection they were making Puppets, live they were still more concerned with tearing through, out-of-place leads be damned. Except for a 1987 VHS Cliff ‘Em All!, there weren’t a lot of official live recordings from this era, odd given how Metallica made their name as a live band. The live tracks here are rough, unpolished, but you can basically smell the beer and sweat from the band and the crowd throughout. Before Burton’s death from a bus accident in 1986 on tour in Sweden, Hetfield considered kicking out Ulrich, an alternate timeline that scores of metal fans might still wish into existence. Loving Metallica and hating Ulrich are not mutually exclusive; Metallica could make more money charging fans and ex-fans to spit on him than they ever did making music. Even as the fantasy lingers, it’s impossible to imagine Metallica without Ulrich. Puppets is the product of brashness with an eye towards heaven, and that’s Hetfield and Ulrich to a fault. And Hetfield was going to make that relationship work: he described early Metallica as the family that replaced his own, his mother died from treating cancer with Christian Science and his father abandoned him when he was young. Burton’s death reopened that feeling of abandonment, making him grip to control even more. Trying to obtain the unobtainable is not for the foolhardy, and it will drain you into a husk if you’re lucky. That’s what Hetfield tried to warn you about on Puppets by yelling at you about chopped breakfasts on mirrors: control is a deathwish that keeps you alive.",10
"15","Oblivion","T-Pain",0,"December 2 2017","Rap","T-Pain’s first studio album in six years cashes in on the good graces he’s received in the interim, but also retreads vastly familiar territory that is more fun than illuminating. It’s somewhat unbelievable that T-Pain would ever feel the need to reintroduce himself, but here we are. Six years removed from his last proper album, he opens Oblivion in grand fashion, kicking open the casket at his own funeral. He offers his gratitude to loyal fans and fuck-yous to those who wrote him off—all before he settles into his lead verse with a succinct reminder of his resume: “I hit the Billboards with a baseball bat.” The charismatic “rappa ternt sanga” dropped his debut single “I’m Sprung” in 2005, setting off the Midas touch era of T-Pain. His signature Auto-Tuned voice landed in the the Hot 100 over 30 times in a five-year period, and everyone from Kanye West to Black Eyed Peas adopted their own renditions. It feels like a musical lifetime has passed since then, but nostalgia and excitement still follow him wherever he goes. The wave crested with his 2014 Tiny Desk concert when a portion of the world learned T-Pain can actually sing without digital assistance. The moment spawned a brief acoustic tour this year and, probably, a glimmer of hope that Oblivion would follow suit. Instead, it finds him channeling the ghosts of past. Nearly every song sounds like it could've been a smash several years ago which is, both, admirable and disappointing. On the one hand, his ability to churn out earworms remains untarnished. The selection is everything T-Pain does best: intoxicating computerized crooning mixed with gratuitous sex and flash. On the other, there’s the admittedly unreasonable expectation that one of Rap&B’s most influential artists would hint at the genre’s next horizon or, at the very least, his own. While there may be a few seeds here, Oblivion settles mostly in his established wheelhouse. Songs like “Straight” and “2 Fine” are low-stakes affairs that find T-Pain playing around with his assorted vocals, flows, and ad-libs—it’s genuinely fun. But his ingenuity shines brightest on the Mr. Talkbox-assisted standout “May I.” Running like two passionate robots serenading a jazz lounge, it is the peak use of a computer to make the voice an instrument unto itself—nearly eight minutes of finesse that only T-Pain could pull off. Oblivion’s most unexpected feature is its mix of sub-genres that T-Pain chameleons himself into perfectly. From trap rap (“Goal Line”) to Latin-flavored pop (“No Rush”) to the percussive lands of go-go (“Cee Cee From DC”), it’s almost like a best-of but with all new music. In his grasp, the respective genres end up sounding poppier rather than like true interpretations, but it's nice to hear an artist push his own creative boundaries—even if the source material is a bit watered down. There’s a masterpiece somewhere in the colors of all these disparate sounds if only it were trimmed just a bit more. As such, Oblivion feels like a “business decision” album: it’s a casual affair that frees him from his label obligation to RCA. It isn’t exactly phoned in, but T-Pain has more in his tank than what he shows here, even though the tracks that reflect his past eras display his versatility and allow for optimistic glimpses of a career resurgence. The free-spirited energy that earned him ubiquity a decade ago remains intact despite his fall from glory. This album reflects the best of what we know of him, but the unknown remains the most intriguing. Projected ambitions aside, this release typifies just how ahead of his time he was and how much those melodic blurred lines influenced the generations that followed—sing-raps can‘t be fully attributed to him, but he certainly played a substantial part. The genre fluidity he shows here helped lay the foundation for artists to come. And even in a landscape that outgrew him or outran him or both, Oblivion T-Pain sounds like a teacher who still feels welcome in his own classroom, and he’s owed at least that.",6.7
"16","Friday on Elm Street","Fabolous / Jadakiss",0,"December 2 2017","Rap","On the New York rappers’ collaboration, just about every bar is sharply written, rapped, and also could’ve been plucked from any project these two have done in the 21st century. There probably was greater demand for a Fabolous and Jadakiss collaborative album in 2002, but far less likelihood of it actually happening. At their commercial peak, the two were inverses of each other: Jadakiss, the grimy hardhead whose overt pop concessions never gave him a bigger single than the one with the 9/11 trutherism; Fabolous, flippant and frivolous, sounding effortless over the flossiest beats of the “MTV Cribs” era. But on the time since, they’ve remained respected veterans with mixtapes and guest verses that play to their strengths without having to address their weaknesses: beat selection, development of a multi-layered personality, artistic evolution, the sort of things that result in great albums. And so what Summerland Tour is to KROQ, Friday on Elm Street is to Hot 97, a nostalgic package deal that consolidates all of the fond memories of past radio hits at the expense of everything that kept their CDs readily available at your local Disc Go Round. Friday on Elm Street has been in development for damn near two years, so it can’t be accused of trying to bandwagon 21 Savage and Offset’s Without Warning. But their commitment to the slasher-flick aesthetic lasts about as long as the intro, which makes a more accurate sales pitch: Fab spends several bars working towards a Harold Miner gag, while Jadakiss rhymes over the drums from Notorious B.I.G.’s “Dead Wrong,” both serving as an ID check to clear out anyone under the age of 30. Like basically everything the duo has done in the past decade, Fabolous and Jadakiss instead spend most of their time enumerating the countless ways in which the current generation are failing to respect a street code of bygone, gullier days. Their voices have aged exceedingly well, and few rappers savor a slightly past-its-prime namedrop quite like Fabolous, though his punchlines are just as likely to land like a punch to the groin, taking all of the air out of the room. If it isn’t obvious by now how much Big Sean picked up from the guy, groaners like, “I humbly put y’all in y’all fuckin’ place, that’s my OCD” should pass for a positive DNA test. Meanwhile, Jadakiss sounded like the proverbial gangster who got chubby and moved to Miami since the get-go, so tough talk always remains convincing, even when he’s face-to-face with Donald Trump “in my man cave watching CNN.” Not surprisingly, this is where Jadakiss and Fabolous are most committed to putting a contemporary spin on ’80s horror, if only for one track. “Talk About It” is a fairly platitudinal survey of America’s political nightmare, though Fabolous shows some rare insight as a political thinker: “Kerr got the credit, forgot about Mark Jackson,” he raps, likely referring to the latter positioning the Warriors as NBA’s wokest team by calling to boycott Clippers games as a protest against Donald Sterling. This is the track that needs a Styles P guest appearance, as he echoed Jadakiss’ attack on the Clinton’s “super predator” policies (“Will Hillary release niggas that Bill locked up?”), in one of the most passionate and cogent arguments for black voter disengagement at the end of 2016. Instead, Styles shows up later on “Ice Pick” for what’s essentially an outtake from the Lox’s muted 2016 comeback, while Fabolous’ solo track “Nightmares Ain’t as Bad” closes out Friday on Elm Street with motivational mogul talk that negates the entire point of the project. As with most of the duo's recent commercial projects, Friday on Elm Street forgoes its obvious throwback appeal to try to exist in a middle-school netherworld. There’s a distinct post-Tunnel Banger approach on Friday on Elm Street, as the duo hone in on flows traceable to The Black Album, others from a few years prior when New Yorkers had to learn how to ride southern beats on the fly. And yeah, Swizz Beatz is all over this thing, but it’s mostly reprising his hypeman role from Kanye West’s “Famous” and his one production credit is a fairly standard Marvin Gaye flip (“Theme Music”) rather than the happy-hardcore Casio abuse that resulted in so many Ruff Ryders anthems with Jadakiss. Whether or not it’s unfair to even dream of a We Are the Streets throwback, most of the production betrays its years in developmental limbo and features the same stainless steel trap beats from not-quite name producers (i.e., Tory Lanez producer C-Sick) that could’ve been given to Dave East, Uncle Murda or any other functional “bring New York back” type. Meanwhile, the inclusion of Future and French Montana suggest some level of commercial expectations, but there needs to be a stronger term than “phoned in” to describe their zen-like lack of engagement; the hooks on “Stand Up” and “All About It” are more like getting an away message from their assistant. The problem isn’t that these two didn’t become the 2017 Gravediggaz; once the initial novelty wears off, the solo tracks stuffed at the end serve as a reminder of how little collaboration took place on Friday on Elm Street. The best crossover franchises of this sort—Run the Jewels, Without Warning—result from contrast or unexpected chemistry, something that presents well-known entities in an unfamiliar light. Just about every bar is sharply written and rapped and also could’ve been plucked from just about any project these two have done in the 21st century. Then again, if an enterprising Canal Street bootlegger did that in 2002 with a compilation of radio freestyles and guest verses intended to settle “top five” debates, it’d be the Fabolous/Jadakiss album we truly deserve—one more like Alien vs. Predator than Friday on Elm Street, a competition rather than a collaboration.",6
"17","Loüm / Go Be Forgotten","Krallice",0,"December 2 2017","Metal","1 / 2 Albums New York City’s most consistent metallurgists offer a deliberate break from their past on their seventh and eighth albums. A decade into a prolific career, Krallice prove newly elusive. By now, Krallice feel like a known entity. For nearly a decade, New York City’s most consistent metallurgists have steadily defined and refined a grand approach to black metal reappraisal. Already veterans of a half-dozen ambitiously athletic instrumental acts, guitarists Mick Barr and Colin Marston use their guitars to stretch the basic shapes of primeval riffs into high-treble, high-tremolo spirals. Drummer Lev Weinstein and bassist Nicholas McMaster have long been more than a rhythm section, warping the shape and powering the stamina of Krallice’s early 18-minute monsters with a sense of time that seemed to contract and expand. For six albums (and the essential EP, Hyperion), Krallice have sharpened each of those elements, contouring them to fit one another with near-peerless precision. They seemed, by this point, a machine. But on their seventh and eighth albums—released during the last six weeks, without fanfare and in quick succession—Krallice offers a deliberate break from what had become a predictive past. On the brief but powerful Loüm, Krallice links with its first-ever special guest, Neurosis co-founder and bassist Dave Edwardson. Though a steadfast backup vocalist with his main act, Edwardson steps up front here, his brusque and hoarse shout clearing the brambles ahead of Krallice’s coiled strikes. He adds careful layers of synthesizer, too, a harbinger for the sudden shift on Go Be Forgotten, Krallice’s most unexpected and revelatory album since very near its start. An unruly mix of vintage rippers and sidewinding explorations, Go Be Forgotten is a stream of surprises, from an opening cover of a black metal obscurity to a swoon-worthy instrumental farewell of chiming guitars and droning keys. In fact, on the masterfully adventurous title track, Marston steps away from the guitar entirely, using the synthesizer to add broad symphonic swells behind the band’s meticulous motion. Nearly a decade into a prolific career, Krallice proves newly elusive. Separated by a generation or two of the American metal vanguard, Edwardson and Krallice certainly are odd bedfellows. Edwardson helped build the framework of modern doom, while Krallice emerged as arguably the most arduous element of the last decade’s U.S. black metal renaissance. But on Loüm, Edwardson lends a kind of blue-collar approachability to Krallice, which has historically used mystic abstraction and fantasy escapades for esoteric lyrics that fit their musical mazes. Edwardson instead arrives as a veteran punk here, lampooning the rich and powerful and grimly surveying a world that seems to be teetering on collapse. “Little man, you’re useless to me,” he stammers like Henry Rollins during “Rank Mankind,” an oligarch’s first-person screed for the commoner. “I hate you/You have no value.” During the fast and agile “Kronus Deposed,” his warnings about “the fear that permeates this world” are given weight by his booming voice, and tumble like loose rocks in a clothes dryer. The bulk of Loüm is prime Krallice, led by a reshaped edge. The unlikely combination works best, however, on a track that sounds like little else in Krallice’s discography—“Loüm,” an entrancing vision of escaping enemy lines by climbing a seemingly insurmountable obelisk. Krallice packs a symphony’s worth of drama and suspense into these eight minutes, with distinct but connected sections that animate the narrative arc like a movie’s score. (And speaking of scores, there’s even a hint of Ennio Morricone’s Spaghetti Western twang in the bridge.) Edwardson plays perfectly the part of the calloused survivor, his voice as damaged and scarred as the body of the fleeing protagonist. On “Loüm,” experience and enthusiasm push one another ahead, with Krallice and Edwardson navigating new territory together. Given that spirit, and the overall sense that Krallice has tired of its own black metal revisionism, the hint of nostalgia that first ripples through Go Be Forgotten may seem discordant. Both “Failed Visionary Cults” and “Chaos of the Living” are Krallice throwbacks, two- and three-minute romps that quickly show how much more expressive and intricate the band has become. Likewise, an opening interpretation of “This Forest for Which We Have Killed”—an exceptionally deep cut from early U.S. black metal band Beastlor—proves how much Krallice has developed its trademark sound. They lift the riff and the lyrics from the original but reshape the rest entirely until it plays like a vestige of their earliest, meanest work. It is a nod to history that overtakes heritage, recasting the past with the power of the present. But the rest of Go Be Forgotten is squarely focused on imagining Krallice’s future, on recognizing that a band that’s focused on the same few elements for a decade can stand new input. There’s an engrossing synthesizer fantasy, a track that newly tests the limits of just how much Krallice can mess with time (“Ground Prayer”), and an epic that may just be the most adventurous thing the band has ever written. Like “Loüm,” “Go Be Forgotten” was written by Barr, and it’s every bit as involved. Opening with a clenched black metal tirade, it shifts gears again and again, from a high-flying guitar solo to a synth tangent and back to both again. You can feel the members recalibrating their highly nuanced instrumental interplay in real time, working their way into a new mold. “I sit and stare at the future/Stuck still,” he screams against the tumult. “Letting it all pass.” That’s an observation, mind you, not an admission: This is the sound of Krallice, suddenly and absolutely unstuck again.",7.6
"18","War & Leisure","Miguel",0,"December 1 2017","Pop/R&B","Miguel’s fourth album has a kinetic sexual and political energy. With less digital funk and more reverbed-out guitar, his R&B psychedelia for uncertain times shows his maturation as a songwriter. Miguel’s ascent into the position of freaky-deaky, celestial sex mystic has been inevitable. Prince Rogers Nelson paved this path so guys like Miguel could thrive, and in Prince’s absence the parallels between the two are even starker and more urgent: a rich voice and richer songwriting extolling eroticism as a balm to heal the vicissitudes of our time and get through this thing called life. Flange and echo pedals are their shared sensual vessels. There’s always going to be a place in contemporary American music for musicians like Miguel, a stony guitarist with an innate sense of the desire behind R&B psychedelia. It’s escapism as a stand-in for freedom both spiritual and actual, a way to shake loose within ever-lusher soundscapes. As Miguel sings on War & Leisure’s homage to his Purpleness, “Pineapple Skies”: “Can we look up, look up, baby/There’s pineapple purple skies/Promise everything’s goin’ be all right.” Like his musical predecessors—Prince, Hendrix, collaborator Lenny Kravitz—all deepened their erotic pull with a sense of justice and moral fortitude, War & Leisure would imply Miguel’s got more than your body on his mind. He’s said as much, at least; in early November, he told Billboard that War & Leisure “is intentionally about the ethos right now, that we are right in the middle of all this.” This would imply a more overtly political album than, say, 2015’s sublime Wildheart, which made Congressional lobbying and the 42nd President into a slinky simile for a come-on, and parsed the feeling of being misplaced in a rigid society; or more political than “Candles in the Sun,” his 2012 call for peace and harmony. But Miguel is a savvy songwriter, and so he swerves on those expectations. His allusions to “the ethos right now” are so far mostly visual, with the video for “I Told You So” featuring clips of Trump protests and earthly ills like nuclear missile launches and glacial melt, as he croons to “baby” about the freedom and pleasure in his love. (In October, Miguel also debuted “Now,” War & Leisure’s most overt social-conscious joint, at a benefit for Schools Not Prisons, a California public education campaign). Instead of offering the more woke/political album he’s been suggesting, this fraught moment has infused Miguel with a kinetic energy that is still mostly centered in his sacral chakra, a pelvic mind concern. It’s juiced-up sex Miguel but with a fire in it, less digital funk and more reverbed-out guitar, a virile, wavy palette and a clear step forward in his maturation as a writer. He’s weaved an album that’s taut and economical, like a featherweight champion landing smoothly choreographed jabs in the form of powerfully raspy harmonies and tight, lusty blues runs. He’s also, like most of us, a bit more on edge this year. Miguel has employed guns-as-sex-metaphors before, in 2010’s “My Piece” and 2015’s too-smoking-to-deal “Coffee,” which characterized cis hetero sex as “gunplay” a flip on the guitar-as-cock trope. On “Banana Clip,” a sneaky grin of a mid-tempo romance serenade, he asserts that he’d do just about anything for his love, up to and including homicide: “M-16 on my lap/Missiles in the sky/No matter where I go on the map/You got my protection/Banana clip on my love for you/Let it ring like braapp.” And on “Criminal,” an evocative Rick Ross-featuring track for when the stroke game’s just too good, it seems like despite the copious pleasure he’s spouting, everything might just be getting to him. Over a chunky guitar riff and the requisite sex-reverb with a Tame Impala-style psych-harmony propping it all up, Miguel declares, “I got a mind like Columbine/Vigilante, I’m volatile/...I just want someone that I can trust,” before the chorus: “It’s so good it feels criminal/This shit’s gotta be criminal.” Yet behind Miguel’s addled thoughts and swaggering cocksmanship, he’s still a consummate dreamer, mitigating his darker impulses with a perpetually sunny sound. Even his more post-apocalyptic songs take an optimistic bent, like “City of Angels,” a pared-down blues croon about doing a woman wrong that also celebrates a deeper outcome. On the upbeat “Caramelo Duro,” assisted by Colombian-American singer Kali Uchis, Miguel sings in Spanish about a sweet and freaky sucia he’s trying to flow down, and while the español is fine, his hefty vocal depth places him in another distinct musical lineage, that of romantic Mexican crooners like Juan Gabriel and Vicente Fernández. Let’s all will a Miguel/Romeo Santos full-length collaboration into existence, too, if only because bachata's falsetto king could use his West Coast, low-end counterpoint. While Miguel, who is black and Mexican American, has sung in Spanish before, the inclusion feels like a statement in and of itself when his very existence is politicized, and perhaps a resolution to the questions he posed on Wildheart’s “What’s Normal Anyway”—the answer to people rejecting your multiplicities is to be yourself even harder. It’s something that Miguel has always done, as an iconoclast in a musical landscape where genres are ever flattening and merging into each other. On War & Leisure, he sounds unconflicted and ready to rumble. The freedom he promises his lovers in his music extends to himself, and he’s better than ever at just letting go.",8.1
"19","Kick","INXS",1,"December 1 2017","Rock","Best new reissue The 30th-anniversary edition of Kick affirms its status as a jewel of ’80s pop-rock. It’s a showcase of the band’s opulent production, slithery grooves, and the allure of Michael Hutchence’s simplicity. INXS recorded albums made for communal euphoria. With thick bottoms and light funk filigrees, their songs fit all the needs of 1980s pop radio, but it was singer Michael Hutchence who distinguished the Australian sextet from Duran Duran. Simon Le Bon could sing about unions of the snake but not shout, “I’ll take you where you really need to be” as INXS’ hit “What You Need” did. The lead single from 1985’s Listen Like Thieves inaugurated a five-year period during which they were as inescapable on radio and MTV as Whitney Houston, George Michael, and U2. Hutchence’s suicide in 1997 has lent this era a beguiling glow: for a while, INXS earned the right to act as if they were a new sensation, a shimmering novelty instead of vets six albums into a career. If time has proven Listen Like Thieves a superior album, the 30th-anniversary edition of Kick makes clear why the six-times platinum release is better remembered. Thanks to Chris Thomas’ sumptuous production, miraculously free of the ’80s’ production stereotypes that scolds like to claim are “dated,” Kick fulfills the title’s promise. Besides, Listen Like Thieves didn’t have “Need You Tonight” and a trio of follow-up singles that kept Kick in the Top 30 for close to a year. By the time the album/tour cycle expired, INXS were one of the world’s most popular concert draws, competing with U2, especially in South America (where they remain, according to conversations with my students, as beloved and canonical as U2). Meanwhile, one thing hasn’t changed: Kick sounds fucking great blasting from the car. This edition makes the point rather too sumptuously: a three-CD/one Blu-ray set, including a Dolby surround-sound version of the original release and a welter of previously available demos and 7” and 12” mixes. In case you don’t need the Kookaburra Mix of “Guns in the Sky” as much as I do, starting with “Need You Tonight” is a good idea. Before it hit No. 1 in January 1988, INXS’ biggest American hit sounded like a classic upon its release, and like many such miracles, its simplicity was the key. Guitarist-keyboardist Andrew Farriss, co-writer of many of the band’s hits, claimed that “Need You Tonight” came to him while waiting for a cab to pick him up at the airport; when he got to Hong Kong, he and Hutchence finished the lyrics. What you hear is a beefed up demo: Farriss’ drum part recorded on a Roland 707 drum machine, keyboard bass, and that riff—maybe the most recognizable opening three notes of the late ’80s. Huffing, whispering, leaping into falsetto, and squealing, Hutchence turned in a performance that was a karaoke version of itself. When Bonnie Raitt covered it in 2016, she didn’t even try to compete; she didn’t have to. All “Need You Tonight” requires is a performer who understands the folly of outsinging the groove. In video form, “Need You Tonight” segued into the nonsensical “Mediate,” during which Hutchence and an obviously hungover band, imitating Bob Dylan in the iconic clip of “Subterranean Homesick Blues” but fabulous in leather, dropped title cards. The other three singles aren’t so much advancements as refinements. Over a rippling guitar line that showed how much INXS had heard from their former producer Nile Rodgers, “New Sensation” shows Hutchence in the declamatory mode that best suited him, with Thomas isolating instrumental elements every time the chorus swings around: a sax bleat, a terse guitar interjection, synth horns; it’s “Original Sin” recast as a plea for world domination. “Devil Inside” is even better: Elton John’s “Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting” with bull’s blood in its veins. The fourth single, released as Kick’s promotional cycle wound down, was the first to peak outside the American top five, but ask anyone born after 1985 and “Never Tear Us Apart” will be the INXS song they know. This ballad, anchored by keyboard strings, is rather blowzy—Hutchence can do the grand manner, but he’s too intense, as if still in that declamatory “Need You Tonight” mode. But millions of fans of Donnie Darko: The Director’s Cut disagree, and so did the band: “Never Tear Us Apart” blasted as Hutchence’s coffin was carried out of St. Andrews Cathedral in 1997. If no one has tried reclaiming Kick as classic, blame the album tracks, which are vestigial at best. “The Loved One” is the band embarrassing themselves with Steve Winwood yuppie blooze. “Calling All Nations” and “Wild Life” boast identical dueling guitar parts, one of which is tuned to “shred.” For a while, though, INXS had enough concentration to cough up a reasonable facsimile like 1990’s X; the top ten single “Disappear” boasts Hutchence’s most convincing show of soul. As they entered the 90s, the band’s steady commercial decline mirrored Hutchence’s personal decline: drugs and a taste for violence led to desultory albums like 1993’s Full Moon, Dirty Hearts, in which Farriss can’t hide his distaste for the pseudo-grunge material he forced himself to write. Hutchence’s death forestalled an ignominious fade. Enough of that. Releasing a collection as overstuffed as Kick: 30th Deluxe Edition in 2017 hearkens back to the opulence of the INXS era itself; to ask whether the album deserves the incense is beside the point. I’m sure U2, obsessed with significance, will get similar treatment. But Kick’s slithery grooves are at least a match for The Joshua Tree’s hymns, and, as the live versions of “Mediate” and “Never Tear Us Apart” included therein attest, INXS at their peak summoned a grandeur no less numinous for being sex-drenched. At this stage in their careers, INXS were more authentic about their lightness than U2 were about their meaningfulness. After all, Bono, a chum of Hutchence’s, also wrote about the devil inside; Michael Hutchence sang as if he’d confronted him—and liked the cut of his jib. The devil was himself.",8.4
"20","Polygondwanaland","King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard",0,"December 1 2017","Rock","Psych-rock band King Gizzard is giving its fourth album of the year away as a free download. The immersive Polygondwanaland is the farthest the seven-piece has strayed from its psych sci-fi roots. The psych rock band King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard chose to release its fourth album of the year—with a fifth supposedly en route—as a free digital download, encouraging fans to create as many copies as they please. “Make tapes, make CD’s, make records,” reads a note accompanying the album’s release. “Ever wanted to start your own record label? GO for it! Employ your mates, press wax, pack boxes. We do not own this record. You do. Go forth, share, enjoy.” Whether they're trying to scale back record expenses, or it’s an altruistic transfer of power to fans, King Gizzard’s decision to surrender control over this album’s physical reach is a comical one. Polygondwanaland is the farthest the seven-piece has strayed from their usual psych sci-fi roots. The band still employ lyrical nerdiness and wigged-out guitar in the album, but whereas King Gizzard’s last records got knee deep in prog rock, Polygondwanaland slinks into those waters until it’s waist high and loses the usual gnarly riffs. Like its mouthful of a title, Polygondwanaland delivers a 10-course meal without dividers between its dishes. Songs seep into one another for an immersive listen. The stirring, quiet percussion of “Inner Cell” tiptoes into “Loyalty” for a slow buildup, before it splashes into the punctuated vocals of “Horology,” a sea of guitar tapping and rich, warm woodwinds. As usual, transitions are key in King Gizzard’s work, but they add a smoothness to Polygondwanaland that makes it particularly digestible, so that every vocal sigh and gaudy synth acts as a complementary flavor. Like the euphoric peaks of 1970s-era Yes or the melodic sections of Emerson, Lake & Palmer’s discography, a solid first impression and a memorable farewell make these type of dense records impactful. King Gizzard put the majority of their stock in this. Polygondwanaland opens with 10 minutes of painstakingly recorded instrumentation on “Crumbling Castle.” Syncopated drumming and clean guitar scales part ways for bandleader Stu Mackenzie and his gentle voice. The song’s vague rumination on sickness and fragility parallels the instruments gently blowing behind him: backing guitars harmonize with one another, a flute solo fades in, and barely-discernable keyboards whirr in the distance. Then, in the song’s final minute, the band trades that for a wall of stoner-metal sludge. Closing track “The Fourth Colour” opts for the same dazzling effect. After endless, bright guitar trills and a rhythmic drone, a risible drum fill prompts the band to wreak havoc in the song's final minute, exploding with the psych rock frenzy of Flying Microtonal Banana or I’m in Your Mind Fuzz. King Gizzard tend to get roped up in the flourishes on Polygondwanaland, before giving way to an instinctive simplicity. At times, it works to their advantage, like when they moderate the dynamics of a feverish tempo on “Deserted Dunes Welcome Weary Feet.” Elsewhere, the band dulls itself by overthinking a section and losing their knack for natural flow. King Gizzard try their hand at hocketing—a technique where multiple singers share a single melody, alternating delivery across multiple notes—near the end of the album, but the focus on how they deliver the syllables loses the spark of the technique’s erratic feel. If there's nowhere left to push their envelope of indie rock ridiculousness, then prying into a genre rarely savored, nevertheless understood, in the 21st century is a bold step. Had they indulged in the campiness, it could have sharpened their own voice within the genre. At the very least, King Gizzard’s decision to give listeners control over the record’s physical production reflects the album’s musical shift. Prog rock is a genre known for disregarding traditional structures and often failing to land perfectly, so King Gizzard drag it out of the basement and into broad daylight with Polygondwanaland to make every triumph and flaw visible. Even if they don’t complete it in time, releasing five albums in a year is cheeky and fun, and they’re smart for giving listeners a way to participate. The album positions King Gizzard as a band more concerned with experimenting openly than with clearing the goal without getting scratched, which any adrenaline-seeker would tell you is the whole point. “P.s. If u wanna make cassettes I don’t really know what you would do,” the end of their note reads. “Be creative. We did it once but it sounded really shit.”",7.2
"21","Call Me By Your Name (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","Various Artists",0,"December 1 2017","None","The soundtrack to Italian director Luca Guadagnino’s new film uses 1980s pop singles and classical pieces to help tell the deliriously romantic story of lovers Elio and Oliver. “Precious youth is short-lived as a dream,” wrote Mimnermus, six centuries before the birth of Christ, and he certainly wasn’t the first Greek poet to romanticize adolescence. Thousands of years later, artists have so thoroughly weighed down the teenage experience with wistful generalizations that it’s nearly impossible to tell stories about it without resorting to cliché. Although it is deliriously romantic, the Italian director Luca Guadagnino’s new film Call Me By Your Name is too deeply immersed in the subjective experience of a singular 17-year-old, Elio Perlman (Timothée Chalamet), to rehash conventional wisdom about youth. The movie spends so much time lingering on sensory details, from the taste of freshly picked fruit to the touch of a lover’s hand to the urgency of its dreamy, eclectic soundtrack, that it practically transport us into his skin. Set in Italy during the hottest months of 1983 and adapted from a novel of the same name by André Aciman, Call Me By Your Name tracks Elio’s affair with his first male lover, Oliver (Armie Hammer), from infatuation to consummation to their inevitable parting. A handsome doctoral student who radiates confidence, Oliver comes to live and work with Elio’s archeologist father (Michael Stuhlbarg) for the summer. For an introspective teenager who’s never truly been in love, and whose hobbies include playing and transcribing classical music, falling for this Adonis in a button-down shirt is like discovering a new language to communicate with the outside world. What’s implicit in his story may be the only genuinely universal truth about adolescence—that it’s a time of blurred borders, when the innocence of childhood starts to chafe like shoes you’ve outgrown, but adult obligations still sound deadening. Identity is at its least stable in these years, when the books and bands you love become your mirror and it only takes a kiss to collapse your unformed self into someone else. The movie gets its title from a scene where Elio and Oliver literally exchange names, as though to annihilate any boundary between them. Its soundtrack translates that electricity, of worlds colliding, into music. The soundtrack unites Elio’s internal life, with its piano compositions and sheet music, and the ’80s pop hits that represent the external reality he accesses through Oliver. Watching the film for the first time, a viewer lost in cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom’s overripe visuals might mistake the piano-driven instrumentals for a score crafted by a single composer. In fact, Guadagnino’s journey into his hero’s psyche is accompanied by works that span continents and centuries. Like Elio—an American Jew living in Italy, who also speaks French with his sometime girlfriend (Esther Garrel)—this soundtrack has an international sensibility and an old soul. Canonical compositions segue into tracks by contemporary innovators like Ryuichi Sakamoto and John Adams. The Canadian pianist André Laplante, as well as the British and Hungarian duo of Valéria Szervánszky and Ronald Cavaye, perform pieces by Ravel. In one scene, Elio plays the gentle “Zion hört die Wächter singen,” from Bach’s chorale cantata “Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme,” three times in a row for a mesmerized Oliver, tweaking each performance to simulate how a different famous composer might put his stamp on it. (The soundtrack features Italian pianist Alessio Bax’s delicate recording of the movement.) Because their relationship is supposed to be a secret, the couple’s dialogue is often coded. There are secret messages in the music, too. “Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme” steals phrases from the Bible’s sensual Song of Songs. One of Sakamoto’s two contributions, the dreamy and then halting “Germination,” comes from Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence, a strange Nagisa Ôshima film where the composer stars as a Japanese soldier in World War II who develops a homoerotic fixation on a prisoner played by David Bowie. Eighties pop singles are scattered amid the classical pieces on a tracklist that looks haphazard but actually represents a thoughtful convergence of sensibilities—one that coheres even without the accompanying images. Most of the songs that blast from speakers at the bars and dance parties Elio and Oliver frequent are cultural hybrids. France’s Bandolero add Spanish phrases, maracas, rap verses, and a dash of English to their appreciation of one Miss Cha Cha Cha on the bouncy “Paris Latino.” Loredana Bertè, an Italian singer who’s known for her eclecticism, brings a throaty nightclub voice, a French catchphrase, and Gallic accordion sounds to her synth-pop gem “J’adore Venise.” You may remember Giorgio Moroder and Joe Esposito’s silky ballad “Lady, Lady, Lady” from Flashdance, which became a teen box-office hit in the spring of 1983. Here, though, lyrics like, “Dancing behind masks, just subtle pantomime/But images reveal whatever lonely hearts can hide,” sound as though they were written just for Elio and Oliver. It’s Sufjan Stevens’ contributions—two new compositions, plus a remix of his Age of Adz track “Futile Devices”—that bring the soundtrack into a wiser, sadder present. Guadagnino has said the songs are meant to serve a similar purpose to voiceover narration in the typical literary adaptation. “We wanted [music] that wasn’t as close to us in first person,” he told an interviewer, explaining that he thought of Stevens because his lyrical indie-folk sounds poignant and elusive at once. His whispery voice first appears midway through the film, when “Futile Devices” plays soon after Elio and Oliver have acknowledged their mutual attraction. It’s a moment of reverie, set to a song that revels in closeup images of a relationship that transcends words. The remix elegantly translates the original’s rippling guitar into Elio’s emotional language: somber piano. Guadagnino only asked Stevens for one song, but he wrote two, and including both is the sole misstep here. “Visions of Gideon,” which plays in the film’s final moments, is stunning. Over twinkling piano and dulled percussion, Stevens nails the surreal experience of reminiscing about an old love: “Is it a video?” he keeps repeating. But “Mystery of Love,” from a happier era of Elio and Oliver’s affair, comes across as twee onscreen and on the album. The rhymes are too neat, the phrasing (“Blessed be the mystery of love”) is too precious, a reference to Alexander the Great’s male lover Hephaestion feels pandering, and Stevens’ coo is so honeyed, it’s cloying. The film’s most recognizable sync, Psychedelic Furs’ “Love My Way,” doesn’t just make for a delightful Armie Hammer meme. It’s also a better anthem for this romance—and a more inspired fusion of Elio’s internal and external worlds—than “Mystery of Love.” While the marimba melody burbles like a piano gone giddy, the lyrics sell a vision of love far more iconoclastic than the one in the first movie it soundtracked: Valley Girl. You probably don’t need Call Me By Your Name to introduce you to the song, but once you’ve seen how it liberates Elio, you may never want to hear it outside the context of this deftly constructed soundtrack.",7.6
"22","Yes Lawd! Remixes","NxWorries",0,"November 30 2017","Pop/R&B","On this collection of remixes from Anderson .Paak and Knxwledge’s 2016 LP, the latter artist flexes his mastery at deconstructing beats and samples—occasionally transforming the mood of a track. When Anderson .Paak and Knxwledge dropped Yes Lawd! on Stones Throw at the end of 2016, they entered the label’s lineage of underground superduos like Jaylib and Madvillain, pairing a vocalist and a producer with complementary styles, with shared ancestors on their musical family tree. They largely lived up to the tradition, lacing what would otherwise be a classic tape from the L.A. Beat Scene with .Paak’s soulful R&B vibe. Each artist stepped slightly outside his comfort zone, and in the process, proved that together they really do have the range. For Yes Lawd! Remixes, .Paak’s vocals are recycled from the original LP, making this collection all about Knxwledge flexing his mastery at deconstructing beats and samples. That they’re his beats to begin with does nothing to diminish his technical prowess. The producer has an uncanny understanding of the function and importance of each instrument, expertly wielding them for effect. He doesn’t have to change much to completely alter the vibe. On “Alltypeofchnces,” he swaps out crunchy static for clean pickwork from an electric guitar; on the “Wngs (Remix),” the track is completely transformed by swapping the drum kit for a dominant percussive bassline. The macabre strings on “Lyk Dis (Remix)” transform its mood from a sexy bedroom jam to something more depressive. Projects like this seem to flow from Knxwledge like water—his Bandcamp page currently offers a staggering 84 albums for sale—and he somehow manages to improve a number of the tracks on this already stellar LP. The original “Suede” impersonated the warm tones of Brian Jackson’s Fender Rhodes, which the remix abandons in favor of airy atmospherics worthy of a Sade record. “Best One” was already lovely, with a smooth organ melody, but the remix manages to be both crunchier and more lush, as the organ takes a backseat to somber strings and what sounds like a vibraphone. It’s gorgeous, and makes the additional “Chppd” version seem superfluous. By its very nature, the Yes Lawd! Remixes were always going to be less consistent than the originals. Knxwledge is essentially disassembling a completed puzzle and re-fitting the pieces back together, occasionally to its detriment. The “Kutless” remix sounds completely Xan’d out, all the energy drained from the original, and the new version of “H.A.N.” has a distracting warble that doesn’t add much to what was Yes Lawd!’s standout track. If nothing else, though, these remixes offer a compelling glimpse into the mind of one of the game’s most talented beat architects, a sample artist freaking his own samples. He doesn’t always stick the landing, but the moments in which he does make it worth the effort.",7.4
"23","Colón Man","Equiknoxx  ",0,"November 30 2017","Electronic","The first proper LP from Equiknoxx is a clear step forward for the Kingston-based digital dancehall duo. Its textures leap from the speakers; the sound design is more vivid than ever. Despite the avant-garde tag that’s sometimes affixed to Equiknoxx’s distinctive brand of digital dancehall—and despite the fact that both of their albums have been released on Demdike Stare’s deeply left-field DDS imprint, where their labelmates are artists like Mica Levi, Shinichi Atobe, and Sunn O)))’s Stephen O’Malley—the duo and its crew of collaborators are not reggae outsiders. Based in Kingston, they are deeply enmeshed in Jamaica’s vast production machine. Over the years, Equiknoxx’s Gavin Blair (Gavsborg) and Jordan Chung (Time Cow) have supplied beats for Ward 21, Busy Signal, and Beenie Man, among others, with credits going back to at least 2005. Still, when they came through with their debut album, late last year, they largely eschewed vocals in favor of spacious, spidery instrumentals, the better to highlight their unusual lattice of staccato beats, mercurial bleeps, and evocative sound effects. The new record, Colón Man, is billed as their “debut LP proper,” presumably because last year’s Bird Sound Power largely comprised previously released tracks going back to 2009, while the new one was made in a concentrated creative burst earlier this year. But Colón Man is clearly cut from the same cloth as its predecessor. Save for a few vocal samples used more for tone color than lyrical signification, it’s entirely instrumental, and its textures leap from the speakers with clinical precision—dry, airless, and charged with electricity, a kind of rock-paper-scissors game between silica packet, vacuum sealer, and anti-static brush. But Colón Man is also a clear step forward. The sound design is more vivid than ever: laser-zap kick drums, underwater gongs, crinkled Mylar, and wooden thwacks so tactile you can practically feel the wood grain beneath your fingertips. It often sounds as if they’ve raided a Foley artist’s storage locker and made off with armloads of noise-making gewgaws: doorbells, birdcalls, tin cans, maybe a leaf blower or two. In “Definitely Not Something Offensive,” a churning loop wheezes like an engine struggling to turn over; in “Enter a Raffle Win a Falafel,” the rattle of a cassette tape being jiggled in its tray rubs up against pitched-down pinball-bumper pings and the duo’s signature eagle screech. (Those titles, meanwhile—other standouts include “Your Ears Are Not Very Small” and “Kareece Put Some Thread in a Zip Lock”—are excellent encapsulations of their surrealistic vision, in which found sounds take on larger-than-life properties.) Rhythmically, their loosey-goosey approach to syncopation takes after producers like Timbaland and the Neptunes, artists who understand the difference a millisecond can make. Their tracks move with an immaculately shuddering, flexing sense of swing, and their beats often feel like (and probably are) the products of pure accident, with loops of incidental clatter layered to create wild polyrhythms, alternately bumptious and slinky. There’s an even more direct link to Steven “Lenky” Marsden, the creator of the “Diwali” riddim, and other dancehall producers who worked with a similar set of sounds and textures—simultaneously springy, brittle, and buzzing—enshrined on the 2001 Mo Wax compilation Now Thing. If some of Bird Sound Power’s more linear instrumentals occasionally wanted for a vocal, the new tunes are entirely self-sufficient. A skilled vocalist could probably find a way to insert him- or herself into their porous weave, but why would you want them to? A voice would only distract from the scintillating interplay of contrasting timbres. No matter how dense their collages become, no two sounds ever occupy the same space or fulfill the same function. Just try to parse the different elements of “Heathen Emissaries From the Dens of Babylon”: wooden rattle, ghostly lowing, bells, basso bleep, vinyl back-scratch, each one occupying its own patch of the spectrum, all as tightly bound together as atomic particles. What might be most impressive about these songs is how deeply abstracted they are, without losing an iota of gut-level appeal. “A World of Welsh” is essentially an opportunity to prove how many different shades of shimmer there are in the world. There’s nothing like a melody, or even conventional musical notes; it’s all incidental sound, as impossible to hum as it is difficult to resist. Pull one piece out, and the whole thing would collapse—but put together, the force it exerts is remarkable. They do occasionally avail themselves of more traditional synthesizer sounds, but very little is of an obviously musical bent. Only Equiknoxx would take melodica player Addis Pablo—son of Augustus Pablo, arguably the instrument’s most famous player—and turn his contributions into an array of squiggles that are all but unrecognizable as a product of the breath-driven keyboard instrument. In “Enter a Raffle Win a Falafel,” a momentary explosion of dub delay serves mainly to highlight how little they depend upon echo, normally a staple of reggae. Equiknoxx’s environments, in contrast, are as exacting as anechoic chambers. Instead of turning to delay as a way of filling up space, Equiknoxx make every sound count. Nothing is wasted and nothing is unwelcome, and every waveform earns its place in the transporting and immaculate final mixdown.",8.1
"24","Rainbow Mirror","Prurient",0,"November 30 2017","Experimental","Commemorating 20 years of his Prurient alias, Dominick Fernow’s sprawling, three-hour foray into “doom electronics” feels like a swing of the pendulum back to the noise project’s Rust Belt roots. Dominick Fernow is not here to make things easy for you. In recent years, the noise trailblazer and Hospital Productions founder has drifted toward respectability, with his military-themed techno project Vatican Shadow taking him out of grimy basements and installing him in superclub DJ booths around the world. Fernow was once characterized as a noise bro, but his work is seldom satisfying in a beer-chugging, rock ’n’ roll way, and often can be deliberately taxing—either actively painful (see the sustained feedback screech of Prurient’s 2008 album Arrowhead) or flirting with monotony, as the negative and depressive energies that course through the project are converted into sound. Rainbow Mirror is not designed to be easily digestible. Released in honor of the Prurient project’s 20th anniversary, this collection clocks in at over three hours in length, spreading out to four CDs or—phew—seven slabs of vinyl. It’s consciously forged in testament to the project’s seldom-documented early days in rural Milwaukee, a period which is memorialized at length in the liner notes, alongside a piece of original fiction written by Fernow and Scott Bryan Wilson. Way back when, Prurient was a trio, and for Rainbow Mirror, it is again. Recording live, Fernow is accompanied by a pair of Hospital Productions regulars, Matt Folden of Dual Action and Jim Mroz of Lussuria, and the resultant sounds have been mixed after the fact by dark-techno magnate Shifted. The music is in a style Fernow calls “doom electronics,” which forsakes Prurient’s familiar blend of feedback pyrotechnics, surging synths, and shrieked vocals in favor of long, sluggish canvases of sound that grind like rusty machinery, or ooze and seep like hot tar; think a 21st-century update of the Eraserhead score, or the exquisite, entropic improvisations of Throbbing Gristle’s Second Annual Report, and you’re on the right track. It’s hard not to be impressed by Rainbow Mirror’s sheer scale. Put it on, go downstairs, bake a cake, mow the lawn, come back, and it’s still going, a swirling void of sound that simmers with morbid unease. The three-man lineup ensures that for all this music’s live, improvisatory provenance, these tracks crackle with textural detail. “Walking on Dehydrated Coral” is a miasma of watery blips and foul synth drool. “Chaos -
Sex” intersperses moments of rumbling ambience with passages that sound like a band saw cutting metal, while the foggy drones and muted percussion of “Path Is Short” might be industrial music for a post-industrial age, where automated processes are pushed to the edge of collapse. Occasionally, moments of unexpected prettiness emerge from the wreckage—see, for instance, the naïve, three-note synth melody that surfaces from the droning turbulence of “Falling in the Water,” though here it is left to revolve ceaselessly until its beauty withers on the vine. Fernow started the decade with a spree of glossy, rhythmic records like 2011’s Bermuda Drain and 2013’s Through the Window that reflected a burgeoning fascination with dance music, refracting noise and power electronics through techno techniques. Rainbow Mirror feels like a swing of the pendulum back to a more freeform, primitive spirit, away from the urban centers of New York, Los Angeles, and Berlin and back toward the Rust Belt that spawned him. For all its imposing scale, though, it lacks some of the dramatic finesse of classic Prurient. Fernow’s poetic lyrics, spoken or shrieked, have been a key hallmark of the project, and without them, these abstracted noisescapes lack the narrative character of his best work. But Prurient also remains defined by its sense of constant evolution, and by burrowing back to its earliest beginnings, Rainbow Mirror feels like a new arc in the Prurient story. Where next remains to be seen.",6.2
"25","Wopavelli 3","Lil Wop",0,"November 30 2017","Rap","Lil Wop—the newest and most adamant Gucci Mane disciple—carves his own grotty, horrorcore path on his fourth mixtape of 2017, a wildly fun but sometimes rough listen. On his breakthrough single “Lost My Mind,” Lil Wop reminisced about growing up wanting to be like Gucci Mane. Of course, Gucci has inspired his share of disciples, but none of them have taken their hero worship to such extremes as Wop, who not only christened himself after his favorite rapper but also had his signature electric ice cream cone tattooed on his own cheek. Even before he signed to Gucci’s 1017 label this summer, Wop was rapping about wearing a Rolex permanently stopped at 10:17—that Oct. 17 also happens to be his birthday is either a fateful coincidence or the kind of lie a determined psychopath might tell as part of an All About Eve-esque plot to infiltrate their idol’s life. If Wop’s biography paints him as rap’s most shameless sycophant, his over the top Gucci fandom belies just how original his own vision is. The two share some of the same bone-dry comedic sensibilities, but beyond that, Lil Wop doesn’t borrow much from the elder Wop. He’s his own creation, and easily the most distinctive 1017 signee since Young Thug: a demonic, blood-crazed madman who likens himself to Michael Myers, brags about his zombie walk, and raps in the same unnerving croak as Tony, Danny Torrance’s freaky imaginary friend from The Shining. All cobwebs and sawdust, it’s a voice so pained and parched it makes you vicariously crave the drink of water he apparently denies himself between takes. It also makes his 1017 debut Wopavelli 3, for all its infectious lunacy, a very acquired taste, and a rough listen on headphones. Wop plays on more or less the same horrorcore tropes that have periodically come into vogue since the Gravediggaz days, but he tackles them with a rare commitment to character. “Fresh as hell, I just woke up in a coffin,” he rasps on “Topgolf,” “Red tape around the trap, bitch don’t cross it.” He’s still early in his career, but already his rapping is considerably richer, weirder, and more vivid than it was on this year’s “Lost My Mind.” Wopavelli 3, his fourth mixtape of 2017, captures him just as his persona begins to click, but still in the creation stage of writing his own mythos. Sometimes he leaves open the possibility all the violence is a Percocet-fueled fantasy; sometimes he hints at a Jekyll/Hyde relationship with his body spurred by his indiscriminate drug intake. Mostly, he doesn’t overanalyze it. “I raise the murder rate, put a nigga on a plate,” he raps with typical brevity on “Murder Rate.” Where vanguard rappers like Lil Uzi Vert and Lil Yachty have modeled themselves in part after rock stars, Wop has taken that mentality to its logical extreme. “This ain’t rap it’s hard rock,” he repeats throughout the tape, and although that’s not literally true, he taps into the same vein of showmanship and exploitation as so many ’80s metal acts. He’s aided in his spectacle by a sharp cast of producers, mostly talented upstarts like Digital Nas and Kenny Beats, who conjure a similar mix of whimsy and brutality, creating beats that fall somewhere between Saturday morning cartoons and torture porn. Early on the mixtape, there’s a moment that Wop’s been anticipating for his entire career: his first Gucci Mane feature. If you can judge how vested Gucci is in his protégés based on the quality of guest verses, then “Paid in Full” bodes well for Wop. But as charismatic as Gucci is, he sounds irreconcilably out of place. He’s too mirthful for his surroundings, and he tips the scale a little too far toward silliness—it’s a bit like watching your favorite sitcom character wander into a slasher film for a scene. Lil Wop’s aesthetic is already so singular that it doesn’t leave a lot of room for outsiders, even ones he grew up idolizing. He may adore Gucci Mane, but with Wopavelli 3 he proves that he doesn’t need him.",6.8
"26","The Greatest Gift","Sufjan Stevens",0,"November 29 2017","Folk/Country","Though too scattered to stand alone, the various demos and remixes culled from Carrie & Lowell add new context and dimension to Sufjan Stevens’ masterful album. Despite its austerity, Sufjan Stevens’ 2015 album Carrie & Lowell aligns more neatly with its immediate predecessors—the synth phantasmagoria of The Age of Adz and the baroque pop odyssey of Illinois—than it does with the singer’s early chamber-folk. All that he learned in crafting those two epics he applied to the hushed reassembly of his grief after his mother’s death, plus a little extra, all-purpose sorrow to boot. Carrie & Lowell sounds cavernous, covered with nooks and fissures and intimate production details—the multi-tracking of Stevens’ worn, cracking voice, the barely audible sleigh bells sparkling across “Should Have Known Better” and the title track’s windswept coda. On the album’s companion anthology The Greatest Gift, Stevens opens a window onto the process of making and living with Carrie & Lowell, from its first tentative iPhone demos to the remixes performed onstage during its accompanying tour. Unlike 2006’s The Avalanche, where Stevens culled B-sides from the 90-minute Illinois plus a few alternate versions of “Chicago,” The Greatest Gift focuses mostly on reframing songs from Carrie & Lowell. Only four tracks here are previously unheard, and it’s easy to see why they didn’t make the album’s cut. “Wallowa Lake Monster” explores the same complicated maternal relationship that haunts Carrie & Lowell through the childlike lens of an aquatic cryptid, which would have thrown an odd third element into the album’s cosmology of stark realism and Christianity. While lovely, “The Hidden River of My Life” taps back into that interminable whimsy—“Suppose the world was not informed by real estate or power lines,” Stevens muses two minutes before declaring himself a beaver—and both “City of Roses” and “The Greatest Gift” could fit right in with Stevens’ many hours of Christmas music. The weary, spectral iPhone demos included here also shed some light into just how an album like Carrie & Lowell is born—in multiple, slow passes, with a lot of deliberation and labor between them. “John My Beloved,” sung into an iPhone mic, features lyrics that would later be tweaked: Stevens reads John for “some kind of stone” instead of “some kind of poem,” and there’s a “ring” and a “life-giving string” that feel a bit like stock objects from the Sufjan Stevens prop closet. In embryo form, “Carrie & Lowell” lacks that memorable coda, ending abruptly after the second verse. These unvarnished sketches hint at the way the entire album may have been written: not in a single outpouring but in halting bursts stifled by each song’s emotional weight. The highlight of the collection is easily the remixes, which tease out the compact stems of the original songs and let them flourish in open, flowing space. Helado Negro helms two remixes, of “Death With Dignity” and “All of Me Wants All of You,” and the way he unwinds previously buried vocal harmonies is enough to make you want a full-blown, album-length collaboration between the two artists. Stevens’ own remix of “Drawn to the Blood” hews close enough to the version on Carrie & Lowell Live, but with crisper vocals, while Doveman’s gentle take on the 2015 tour single “Exploding Whale” lends as much gravitas as possible to a song that contains the words “epic fail.” Though too scattered to stand alone, The Greatest Gift adds new dimension to Carrie & Lowell. It’s easy enough to read albums, especially those as moving as Stevens’, as ironclad cultural objects, produced once and then immutable. The Greatest Gift contextualizes the work more as a living document. It exposes shadows of the album’s past and future, and for that, it’s exquisitely generous.",7.2
"27","Blue Lips","Tove Lo",0,"November 29 2017","Pop/R&B","Of a piece with last year’s Lady Wood, the Swedish pop singer’s new album chronicles the death of a doomed, passionate love affair. It makes a powerful statement about female sexuality in the process. Tove Lo doesn’t do coy. On “bitches,” an ode to bisexual liberation smack dab in the middle of the Swedish pop singer’s new album, she pummels through the first verse without an ounce of irony. “Let me be your guide when you eat my pussy out/’Cause I’ve had one or two, even a few/Yeah, more than you,” she asserts, as laser beam keyboards sputter around her. Even without the healthy levels of Lil’ Kim-grade raunch, “bitches” is a red-hot, gut punching song by an artist who is not afraid to resoundingly state what she wants, when she wants it. “Bitches, I don’t trust ’em/But they give me what I want for the night,” she sings in the chorus, succinctly illustrating the core philosophy behind Blue Lips, and its predecessor, 2016’s Lady Wood: gone are the days when sexual dominance was the realm of men alone. Blue Lips is subtitled [lady wood phase II], and it comprises parts three and four of Lo’s pair of concept albums. Both albums chronicle the birth and death of a tumultuous love affair, doomed by an all-consuming, self-destructive passion. Although sex is absolutely the lens through which Lo explores this relationship, it never feels as if she’s performing for the male gaze, and although she flirts with camp, it’s in a self-aware way that conveys a certain seriousness. The first half of Blue Lips, titled “LIGHT BEAMS,” begins with the lead single, an uptempo dance track called “disco tits.” It blends 1970s disco, 1990s house, and Lo’s penchant for humor and entendre all into one neat package dripping with erotic mirth. The musical apex of Tove Lo’s career thus far, “disco tits” uses clever structural elements—like a single-bar a capella pre-chorus that ramps up the track’s energy before the stinging pulse of the refrain—to create something that is slinky, cool, and relentlessly driving. “I’m wet through all my clothes/I’m fully charged, nipples are hard/Ready to go,” she sings, almost deadpan, once again presenting herself as the central focus of her lust. The track is the quintessential example of the effect Lo wishes to achieve—songs about the complexity of female sexuality that make their point through the irreverence of pop music. Case in point: in the “disco tits” video, Lo drives a convertible down a desert highway, while receiving road head from a furry yellow puppet. Lo wears her influences on her sleeve here. “disco sits” is an homage to shimmering ’70s dance pop, calling to mind Andrea True, the late disco diva whose 1976 hit “More, More, More” brought second-wave sex-positive feminism to light-up dancefloors across the country. Blue Lips is not a straight-up disco record, but Lo uses that genre’s soft focus sheen to recall an era grown from the sexual liberation of the ’60s, while sheltered from the excesses of the ’80s. Coupled with her evocative songwriting skills, Blue Lips elicits an air of fantasy, a defined context in which the most potent desires can be explored and examined. “LIGHT BEAMS” is the more upbeat side of Blue Lips, the final climax before the comedown. “stranger,” another highlight from this half of the album, is built around a funky, mock-Prince guitar lick, supported by echoing snare drums and some of Lo’s most powerful vocals to date. It’s the part of the narrative where, with her relationship already in shambles, Lo goes on the prowl for a one-night stand—and the yearning in her voice, almost cracking, is the deepest point of the record. It sets the stage for “PITCH BLACK,” the final Lady Wood suite, where Lo winds down and bottoms out after her debaucherous journey. While its stark contrast to “LIGHT BEAMS” works conceptually, the transition is a little rough. Tracks like “romantics,” with its trendy trap beats and distorted vocals, pale slightly next to the wild ride of the album’s first half. “struggle” indulges in Lo’s puzzling love for millennial slang (“The struggle is real,” she sings on the song’s hook), but it also sees Lo at her most introspective and vulnerable. If Rihanna and her army of copycats popularized tropical pop in the past few years, this is a tropical depression, its bubbly demeanor completely tempered by an encroaching darkness. “Fuck, fuck, fuck some sense into me,” Lo pleads, definitely more of a supplication than a come-on. With Lady Wood, it seemed like Tove Lo had found a way to separate herself from the ever-growing crowd of Scandi-pop artists, expanding on real, human themes instead of by-the-numbers love ditties washed over with icy synth production. Blue Lips continues in this direction, an explicit testament to Lo’s chaotic love life, an unashamedly sexual and emotionally impactful piece of work. Lo ends up baring much more of her soul than her body.",7.1
"28","4444","Sam Gendel",0,"November 29 2017","Jazz","Sam Gendel’s smoothly psychedelic debut is dominated by the guitarist and saxophonist’s tip-toed melodies and hushed voice. Sam Gendel was a saxophonist first and guitarist second. “My heart belongs to the saxophone, but guitar is my secret lover,” he told an interviewer a couple years ago. With both instruments at his side, he works primarily in a psychedelic jazz trio alongside drummer Kevin Yokota and guitarist Adam Ratner. Under Gendel’s direction, the group performed as Inga until recently, when they began releasing music under Gendel’s given name. Separately, Gendel plays support in Moses Sumney’s trio, and has just recently released his own wholly solo material of one-take live recordings of saxophone and wavedrum loops preserved to his iPhone voice memo app. Gendel has spent the last couple years as a searching musician, and his debut full-length for Terrible Records, 4444, sounds exploratory but sure of itself. It wasn’t until some later Inga recordings that Gendel began singing, and he’s extended the effort on 4444, a smoothly psychedelic record dominated by hushed voice. Gendel barely plays the saxophone here, instead streamlining a guitar style he’s been developing over the years. In that way, 4444 feels like a simultaneous exploration of a pair of tones. Most every moment and accompanying sound on the album pays service to his settling into both. Gendel sings quietly and at a pattering pace reminiscent of his guitar playing, where his muted staccato attack sounds like tiptoeing over the fretboard in socks. He sometimes sings in unison with his guitar for a silvery effect, and Yokota’s percussion seems to double instead of define his trajectory. All of this sounds smooth but dense, wrinkled with a passionate and meditative meticulousness instead of a detached technicality. If the playing is grounded, Gendel’s lyrics tend toward floaty, guileless pietism. On “No Place For This” he sings, “Anger is not an answer,” his voice lifting upwards and more loudly at the end of the phrase. At the end of the album, a hidden track begins with a withered home recording of a child belting out lines from Bill Martin Jr. and Eric Carle’s famous children book Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? Gendel carries forward the lyrical device of trading perspectives, trying to see the world through other eyes as a sort of radical awareness. At another point, he borrows lines from the Native American poet-activist John Trudell, channeling the late artist’s existential exasperation. “Look at us, we are healing/Look at them, their medicine is patented,” Gendel sings. On “DAVE” he instead sounds dire and a little corny in his ruminations. “The drones are reigning hellfire on the Dalai Lama/As English majors have a fight about the Oxford comma,” he bites, and later, “The aliens were gonna visit but they’re gonna wait.” That song is also the album’s funkiest fusion, plodding along at a start-stop pace that eventually gives way to the album’s dizziest and busiest moment, Gendel’s sax panting circles in the background. Elsewhere, it sounds like Ratner that plays a gliding solo of elongated single notes on “Lof” while Gendel doodles a mantra in the background. Similarly, the open strumming on “Portrait Orchid Gun” by Brazilian guitarist Fabiano do Nascimento at the end of the album feels like an abrupt program change. These small moments position Gendel’s muted tone as the centerpiece from which things deviate. Gendel channels a spiritual mysticism in both his music and the way he talks about it. His lyrics shape a vague, flower-child politics and his sounds are cerebral and psychedelic. For 4444, he encourages listening to the record in reverse tracklist order as a sort of secondary study. Doing so doesn’t flesh out a conceptual revelation from the lyrics, but restaging the tracks does reposition the album’s pace and sense of direction. In reverse order, instead of expanding outward, Gendel’s music starts expansive and then narrows in, drilling down meditatively. It’s a strange effect that playing 4444 backwards sounds even more like an artist settling into their voice.",7
"29","Plant Age","Terekke",0,"November 29 2017","Electronic","On his debut album, the L.I.E.S. mainstay makes house music that’s dubby and lo-fi, like club tracks heard through a pillow. Matt Gardner’s understated, fuzzy house music as Terekke often feels greater than the sum of its parts. His 2013 track “Amaze” was a veritable underground ambient house hit: A highlight of L.I.E.S.’ Music for Shut-Ins compilation, it also kicked off a mix CD from Sven Väth’s Cocoon Recordings, an Ibiza perennial. At that time, L.I.E.S. was still in its infancy, and the role that dusty, hardware-based bedroom techno from Bushwick would play in the proliferation of this sound across the world was still undetermined. These days, Terekke calls Amsterdam home, but he remains a key part of the label family. Now on its 100th release, L.I.E.S. brought Gardner back for his debut album, and its eight tracks are an elegant and sedate summation of Terekke’s lo-fi oeuvre, pushing his sound into even deeper territory with a subtle, singular touch. Terekke’s music is like a warped, alternate-reality version of Burial. Though the two producers conjure disparate moods (where Burial is rainy and despondent, Terekke is warm and hopeful), they take a similar approach to abstracting dance music into its own world, inside your headphones and your head. The two producers also share an affinity for using samples from pop stars like Mariah Carey or Beyoncé, melting their voices into gooey echoes that feel familiar but unplaceable. On last year’s “i wanna what love is,” Terekke molded Carey’s voice into a spectral image, and on 2014’s “Untitled B1,” under his X alias, he sampled Sade’s “Is It a Crime” into a loose, rippling club jam. Terekke’s skeletal, dubby approximations of house reflect the same deconstruction-reconstruction of dance music as Burial, though Gardner meshes inspiration from Chicago house and Berlin dub techno, where Burial reflects the musical legacy of the UK underground. Plant Age is an album as comfortable and versatile as your favorite sweater—it’s lived-in, welcoming, and warm. Recorded sporadically over the past five years, it’s considerately sequenced and is glued together in a fairly uniform haze. The congruousness of Plant Age, the ubiquitous smoky gel that cushions all of his tracks, speaks to Terekke’s fondness for recording to cassette tape. The album effectively sets a mood and continues to reveal itself more deeply upon repeated listens. “BB2” is the clubbiest cut on the release, a muted yet pounding house track that sounds like it’s being played through a pillow. “BB2” hews closest to Terekke’s older material, with gorgeous oozy chords peeking through a smoky haze, and a ghostly vocal sample makes the song both spooky and forlorn. Parts of Plant Age pass through inconspicuously—the ambient gestures of “Swim,” “Padi,” and “Closer” are lush and unassuming. A surface-level listen can find respite in the calm atmospheres, while closer attention reveals hidden layers of smudged melody and endless detail in the lo-fi fuzz. The generous, thumping dub of single “Mix 91” features little more than ricocheting drums, a minimal bassline, and a featherlight synth, but Terekke’s effects conjure sublime spaciousness with surprising economy. With everything in the studio plugged in and synced up, it feels like these tracks write themselves, pouring out as effortlessly as smoke. The intricacies of Terekke’s dubbed-out mixing rival the spacey sensuousness of Basic Channel or Huerco S.: Each track seemingly extends from horizon to horizon, bouncing and echoing to infinity. No track on Plant Age reaches six minutes, yet the atmospheres are so engrossing, each cut is a world in itself. The album’s 33 minutes both feel like an eternity and a blip—once through, you wonder where the time went and how it could have passed so quickly.",7.9
