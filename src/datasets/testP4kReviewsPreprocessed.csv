months old band played final show nearly year later released first album greeted big shrug critics fans alike tweedy managed retain almost every member uncle tupelo’s expanded lineup multiinstrumentalist max johnston guitarist john stirratt drummer ken coomer even guitarist brian henneman bottle rockets fact group briefly flirted idea keeping uncle tupelo name although wiser heads prevailed rechristened trucker lingo “will comply” still despite familiarity camaraderie wilco still trying figure wrote recorded am—a necessary step band especially one whose de facto frontman spent last decadeplus shadow forceful farrar original mix reportedly much grittier akin uncle tupelo’s early material cleaner polished version finally made way cd stores march  final version fine although definition altcountry conservative punk rock flourishes pedal steel gentle twang frame tweedy’s hardluck tales casino losing streaks suspended licenses custody battles record collections “i must high” nods toward sunny pop summerteeth beyond “box full letters” “passenger side” hint melancholy melodicism would become tweedy’s stock trade wanted wilco collaborative democratic unit rather glorified solo project though one bandmates’ songs made final cut gently loping “it’s simple” courtesy stirratt pens new liner notes expanded edition otherwise mvp album henneman fine foil tweedy there’s real wit warmth guitar riffs even merely rental rather full band member according learning die greg kot’s  biography band henneman recorded part raucous throwaway “casino queen” nursing broken heart downed two bottles gin tape started rolling plays like he’s holding dear life album persistently defined unfavorable comparisons first son volt’s trace later every wilco album certainly there’s timidity must discouraging tweedy’s strong contributions uncle tupelo’s final pair albums there’s also lot humor sadness songs circumscribed local scope that’s charm modest reissue includes handful bonus tracks including final uncle tupelo recording blue mountain cover treats something footnote wilco’s long career  album plays like band setting terms striving keep everything perfectly humansize much band

painful adjustments expectations floundered ticket sales cratered hadn’t turned setbacks songs probably wouldn’t reading review wilco reissues every bit confident debut shaky double album tied together loose theme means rock‘n’roll band opens big blast lurching serrating guitar distortion sinewy visceral violent sounds like they’re tearing start what’s amazing well works grinding din begins ends opener “misunderstood” tweedy’s songs brand new context “far far away” “i got end century” aren’t actually different sound heavier riskier stakes much greater could different band altogether country flourishes specifically pedal steel courtesy freakwater’s bob egan wilco managed transform altcountry alsoran real rock band noise rock classic rock folk rock heartland rock every kind rock conceptually knotty record contains barely veiled references breakup listeners time would understood references uncle tupelo rather romantic partner “monday” stonesy brass stomp guy “a plenty good band” watch others get glory guess might inspired tweedy’s wry observations fame futility  pulled punches “i know you’re mama’s boy” doesn’t much sting thankfully aren’t dis tracks bitter recriminations jay farrar’s minor concern songs first foremost jeff tweedy misgivings talent detriment it’s band’s greatest strength truest subject rock‘n’roll sucker’s bet songs something pour heart soul money labor dreams creative financial frustration “we’ve got solidstate technology” tweedy sings “redeyed blue” “tapes floorsome songs can’t afford play” even that’s wilco trying figure need help it’s useful imagine songs sung stage directly explicitly audience paid see wilco tweedy sings “i got end century” “i got still believe you’re ever needit’s you” “you” means us enough applause really

wildest wooliest maybe raucous wilco ever sounded “well know i’ve made mistakes” sings “i’m passing on” think song ending band kicks though reluctant stop playing song ends face real life heart bruised tender record frazzled relationship artist audience makes reissue powerful essential typical album repackaging digital media means audience less less give artist rock‘n’roll may even fool’s errand  people bought cds handful even midlevel band like prefoxtrot wilco could make comfortable living driving around country van sounds even direr desperate bonus material expands upon themes “party horn” mix “monday” actually sounds richer excitable studio version especially screeching sax solo outtakes alternate takes still studio chatter attached showing band goofing around studio halfassing demos “i think good enough” tweedy deadpans beautifully understated version “dynamite soul” tweedy’s big ideas vocation sound even volatile two full live sets included xcd version “sunken treasure” “hotel arizona” making tweedy’s rapport audience “this true story sorta” noise crowd maybe that’s album’s title comes course reference  peter sellers film it’s also twist old adage concerts concert films guess we’ve always crucial part always unseen force motivating wilco one show next live cuts make explicit it’s though tweedy played long game sucker’s bet waiting  years make ultimate
